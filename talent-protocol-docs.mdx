# Get Started

How to get started using Talent Protocol's API

## Reputation Infrastructure for Builders and Creators

Talent Protocol helps builders and creators get rewarded by making their reputation more visible.

We track builder activity across blockchains, GitHub, Twitter and other platforms, to calculate a [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score) that helps ecosystems reward real contributors.

With Talent Protocol:

- **Builders** get rewarded for shipping real apps
- **Creators** get rewarded for sharing engaging content
- **Ecosystems** can reach and reward top builders and creators
- and **Apps** can integrate verified reputation data with a single API call

With over 11M+ accounts indexed and dozens of apps integrating our API, Talent Protocol is building the reputation layer for the new internet.

## What Can You Build?

- **Identity & Auth**: Add reputation-based context and authentication to your app.
  - Examples: [Basenames](https://x.com/TalentProtocol/status/1825995151275434439) and [Etherscan](https://x.com/TalentProtocol/status/1830974248363622607)
- **Search & Discovery**: Find top builders based on verified reputation data
  - Examples: [Veew.ai](https://veew.ai/) and [Talent App](https://app.talentprotocol.com/search)
- **Reputation Systems**: Create custom scoring systems using our data primitives.
  - Example: [Moxie](https://build.moxie.xyz/the-moxie-protocol/based-rewards#breakdown-of-the-formula)

## Quick Start

1. Get your testing API key on our [app](https://app.talentprotocol.com/developers), or [contact us](https://tally.so/r/mYYjPJ) for a full access one.
2. Explore our [API Reference](/docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference)
3. Jump into specific guides:
   - [Authentication](/docs/developers/talent-api/authentication)
   - [Builder Score](/docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference/get-a-specific-score-using-wallet-scorer-slug-talent-id-or-account-identifier)
   - [Credentials](/docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference/get-the-score-and-the-credentials-using-wallet-scorer-slug-talent-id-or-account-identifier)

## Core Concepts

Talent Protocol is built around the following core concepts to create a comprehensive reputation system:

- [**Profile**](/docs/protocol-concepts/profile): The unified representation of a builder's identity and reputation data. A Profile can represent either a verified User or an independent Account.
  - Users can have multiple connected Accounts feeding data into their Profile
  - Independent Accounts have their own Profile until claimed by a User
- [**User**](/docs/protocol-concepts/user): An individual who has signed up on one of our apps and verified their identity. Users can connect multiple Accounts.
- [**Account**](/docs/protocol-concepts/account): A connection to a third-party data source (wallet, GitHub, X, etc.) that provides reputation data.
- [**Data Point**](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point): A specific verified fact about a builder (GitHub stars, wallet transactions, etc.).
- [**Events**](/docs/protocol-concepts/event): Historical records of reputation changes
- [**Score**](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems): A numerical measure of reputation calculated from Data Points using a specific Scoring System.

## Support

## smart-contracts.mdx
# Smart Contracts

## Talent Registry

- An onchain record of Talent accounts created and the respective wallet address.
- Contract: [https://basescan.org/address/0xb477A9BD2547ad61f4Ac22113172Dd909E5B2331](https://basescan.org/address/0xb477A9BD2547ad61f4Ac22113172Dd909E5B2331)

## $TALENT Token

- The utility token for Talent Protocol that incentivizes ecosystem participants to verify reputation data.
- Contract: [https://basescan.org/token/0x9a33406165f562E16C3abD82fd1185482E01b49a](https://basescan.org/token/0x9a33406165f562E16C3abD82fd1185482E01b49a)

## Builder Score Onchain

- An onchain snapshot of the Builder Score of a given Talent ID and wallet address.
- Contract: [https://basescan.org/address/0xBBFeDA7c4d8d9Df752542b03CdD715F790B32D0B](https://basescan.org/address/0xBBFeDA7c4d8d9Df752542b03CdD715F790B32D0B)
- Developers can query the Builder Score of all user via the Talent API, but also access the Builder Score of Builder+ members onchain, via a custom contract.
- **Example**: Base reads the onchain Builder Score smart contract to validate if a user has a Builder Score ≥ 50 in order to provide a discounted [Basename](https://www.base.org/names). This means that to qualify for a discount, user needs to have a Builder Score ≥ 50 and be a Builder+ member.

# Account

An Account represents a connection with a third-party data provider.

An **Account** represents a connection with a third-party entity (e.g., Wallet Address, GitHub, X, LinkedIn) that feeds reputation data into Talent Protocol. Accounts can exist independently or be linked to a user.

A [**User**](/docs/protocol-concepts/user) represents an individual that signed up on talentprotocol.com to verify their reputation data and increase their [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score), by connecting multiple [**accounts**](/docs/protocol-concepts/account)**.**

## Key Attributes:

- **Accounts** have Account IDs (previously know as Passport ID) and account-specific URLs (until they're linked to a user), following this format:
  - `talentprotocol.com/address/0xbd…23d4`
  - `talentprotocol.com/github/filmacedo`
- If linked to a user, the account URL will automatically redirect to the user’s profile URL. Otherwise, it will show the data from that imported account independently.
- Once linked to a user, an account loses its independent profile and redirect to the user’s profile. The account also loses its [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score), and its data feeds into the user’s aggregated reputation.
- Accounts display their own [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score) unless linked to a user, at which point their data integrates into the user’s aggregated [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score).
- Users can claim an imported account by verifying ownership (e.g., signing a wallet message, connecting GitHub).

## Types of Accounts:

- I**ndexed Account**: All accounts being tracked by Talent Protocol, whether connected by users or imported automatically.

- **Imported Account**: Public accounts indexed directly by Talent Protocol, without any explicit user action, such as curated wallet addresses or public GitHub profiles.

- **Connected Account**: Accounts actively linked to a user’s profile and with verified ownership.

## Account Sources

Accounts can come from various sources:

- `wallet`: Cryptocurrency wallets (Ethereum, Base, etc.)
- `github`: GitHub developer accounts
- `farcaster`: Farcaster social accounts
- `lens`: Lens Protocol accounts
- `x_twitter`: Twitter/X accounts
- `linkedin`: Professional LinkedIn profiles
- `talent_protocol`: Native Talent Protocol accounts
- `worldcoin`: World ID verified accounts
- `self`: Self-verified information

## Account Properties

- `identifier`: The unique identifier on the source platform
- `source`: The platform or data provider (see Account Types)
- `owned_since`: When the account was first created
- `connected_at`: When the account was connected to Talent Protocol
- `username`: The user-friendly name on the source platform

## Account Relationship to Profiles

- An Account can exist independently with its own [Profile](/docs/protocol-concepts/profile)
- When claimed by a [User](/docs/protocol-concepts/user), the Account feeds data into the User's Profile
- Multiple Accounts from different sources can be connected to a single User Profile

## Accessing Account Data

[API](/docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference) provides endpoints to:

- Retrieve accounts associated with a profile
- Search profiles by account identifiers
- Access data points sourced from specific accounts

# Data Issuer

A Data Issuer is the trusted entity associated with Data Point on Talent Protocol.

## Key Attributes:

- Represents the source of trust for the data (e.g., GitHub, Base, ENS).
- It can be distinct from the technical provider where Talent Protocol fetches the data from ([Accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account)).
- Some Data Issuers can also be [Accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) (e.g., GitHub), while others are not (e.g., Base).
- Some [Accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) can provide multiple data issuers (ex.: wallet address)
- A single Data Issuer can provide multiple [Data Points](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point).

## Examples:

- GitHub is both an Account (where we get the data from technically) and the Data Issuer (entity that we trust to issue reputation data to a subject).
- Base is a Data Issuer, with multiple Data Points (number of transactions, smart contracts deployed, ...), but it's not an Account. The account in this case is the wallet address.

---

## data-point.mdx
---
sidebar_position: 4
---

# Data Point

A Data Point is specific type of reputation data about a given user.

## Key Attributes:

- A Data Point provides a verified fact about a user's reputation at a given point in time.
- A Data Point is always associated with a [Data Issuer](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-issuer).
- A Data Issuer can have multiple Data Points, but a Data Point only has one Data Issuer.
- A Data Point only contains objective and verifiable data.
- A Data Point doesn't store any scoring information; they can be use in multiple scoring systems.
- Example:
  - Data Issuer: `GitHub`
  - Data Point: `Stars`
  - Value: `[number of stars]`

## **Variable** and I**mmutable** Data Points:

- Immutable data points are simpler versions of variable data points.
- **Variable Data Points** contain a value that can change over time.
- Example: GitHub Stars, ETH Balance on Base
- **Immutable Data Points** are only set once, and never recalculated again.
- Example: Base Learn, KYC, First Transaction on Base

## Categories of Data Points:

- **Metrics**: Ongoing measurable activities (e.g., GitHub contributions, transactions)
- **Achievements**: One-time accomplishments and permanent credentials (e.g., a hackathon win)
- **Affiliations**: Memberships and group affiliations that can be lost or revoked (e.g., job or a DAO)
- **Accounts**: Social profiles and other verifications (e.g., twitter, farcaster, github)

## Scoring Tags

- We use a **tag-based system** that determines how data points are used in [Scoring Systems](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems):
  - Initial tags: `human`, `builder`, `creator`
  - Data points can have multiple tags
  - Scoring systems use tags to determine which data points to include

---

## event.mdx
---
sidebar_position: 5
---

# Event

An Event is a historical record of changes to a user’s reputation data over time.

Events to track how reputation changes over time, giving users better insights into their progress. Think of it like Etherscan for the Builder Score: users will be able to see not just their current reputation state, but the complete history of how they got there.

Every change to reputation data is recorded as an Event with its old value, new value, and timestamp.

## Key Attributes:

- Represents a chronological log of changes to each [Data Point](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point):
- Each event stores: `old value`, `new value`, `timestamp`
- An Event does not include scoring information but is used to calculate scores when processed.

## Event vs Data Point

- A [Data Point](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point) shows the current state (e.g., total commits), and the Event tracks the history of changes leading to the current state.
- Just like Etherscan, where you see both the current token balance (state) and the transactions (events) that built up to it.

## Profile Properties

Profiles contain several key properties that constitute a builder's identity:

### Basic Information

- `id`: Unique identifier for the profile
- `name`: The builder's name
- `display_name`: The displayed name that may differ from the primary name
- `bio`: A short biography or description
- `location`: Geographic location
- `image_url`: Profile picture URL

### Reputation Properties

- `human_checkmark`: Boolean indicating if the profile owner has been verified as human
- `onchain`: Boolean indicating if the profile has verified onchain presence

## scoring-systems/builder-score/builder-score-levels.mdx
# Builder Score Levels

Breakdown of the 6 Builder Score Levels and implementation guidelines for developers.

Builder Score Levels provide a structured way to understand and interpret Builder Score values in the Talent Protocol ecosystem. These levels help both developers integrating our API and individual builders track progress and set goals.

## Understanding Builder Score Levels

Builder Score is an uncapped scoring system that measures a builder's verified reputation data across multiple categories. To make these scores more intuitive and actionable, we've established six distinct levels that represent increasing degrees of building activity and impact.

Each level corresponds to a specific Builder Score range:

| Level | Name         | Score   | Range                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Novice       | 0-39    | Just getting started with the basics. They've connected some accounts and taken their first steps as a builder.              |
| 2     | Apprentice   | 40-79   | They're building sporadically and starting to make their mark. Their contributions are starting to get noticed.              |
| 3     | Practitioner | 80-119  | They've established themselves as serious builders with real impact. Their work speaks for itself across multiple platforms. |
| 4     | Advanced     | 120-169 | They've built some impressive things and contributed to notable projects. Their reputation is solid and growing.             |
| 5     | Expert       | 170-249 | They're among the top builders with an exceptional track record. People look to their work as an example.                    |
| 6     | Master       | 250+    | They're one of the most accomplished builders in the ecosystem with contributions that have made a real difference.          |

## Use Cases

- **Base**: Offers discounted Basename registrations for builders at Level 3 (Practitioner) or higher
- **Hackathons:** Prioritizes hackathon applications from builders at Level 4 (Advanced) or higher
- **Communities**: Automatically approves membership for builders at Level 2 (Apprentice) or higher

## Implementation Guide

When integrating Builder Score into your app or protocol, you can use these levels to:

- **Access Control**: Gate specific features or capabilities based on Builder Score Levels
- **User Segmentation**: Create targeted experiences for different builder segments
- **Reward Distribution**: Allocate rewards or incentives proportionally to builder levels
- **Interface Design**: Visually represent levels with badges or other UI elements
- **Governance Rights**: Allocate voting weight or proposal rights
- **Recommended Level Requirements:**

- General access and basic features: Level 1 (Novice)
- Premium features and moderate incentives: Level 3 (Practitioner)
- Exclusive access and significant incentives: Level 5 (Expert)

## Onchain Level Badges

Builders will be able to mint achievement badges for each Builder Score Level they reach. These badges:

- Serve as permanent proof of achievement
- Can be displayed on profiles across the web3 ecosystem
- May unlock special perks from ecosystem partners
- Create a collection that visually represents a builder's journey

## Important Notes

- **Absolute Values**: Builder Score Levels are based on absolute score values, not percentile ranks.
- **Forward Evolution**: As our protocol adds more data points and users, the distribution of levels will naturally evolve.
- **Periodic Review**: We review and may adjust level ranges periodically to maintain meaningful separation between tiers.
- **Non-Decay**: Once you've minted a level badge, it remains in your collection even if your Builder Score temporarily decreases.

## scoring-systems/builder-score/index.mdx
# Builder Score

=============

A scoring system to recognize real onchain builders.

## What is the Builder Score?

Builder Score is a numerical value that represents a user's reputation as an onchain builder.

The Builder Score aims to distinguish builders from other types of crypto users, by valuing both the quantity and quality of their contributions. It reflects both "potential" (future growth) and "achievements" (proven track record).

Users can leverage their Builder Score within Talent Protocol's growing partner ecosystem, while developers can easily add the Builder Score to their apps.

Apps like [Basenames](https://x.com/TalentProtocol/status/1825995151275434439) or [Etherscan](https://x.com/TalentProtocol/status/1830974248363622607) already integrate with the Builder Score to bring more context to their users and to curate the best builders in crypto.

## The "Builder Score" Scoring Framework

All Talent Protocol scoring systems are composed of a selection of [Data Points](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point). While we don't disclose the exact formula to prevent gaming, we can share that each Data Point is evaluated based on:

1.  value conversion (when applicable)
2.  signal strength
3.  max score
4.  multiplier (not publicly disclosed)

### 1. Value Conversion

For some Data Points it's helpful to normalized their numerical value before applying the scoring function, but this is an optional step.

Examples:

- Convert `twitter_account_age` from a `timestamp` to the `number of years` the account has.
- Normalize `base_out_transactions` with a `sqrt` function to reduce the impact of large values, making the scoring system more balanced and fair, and ensuring big contributors don’t completely overpower smaller ones. This means that your first contributions matter more than later ones.
- Invert `farcaster_social_capital_rank` value, so that the #1 ranked user has a higher value (and more points) than the last ranked user.

### 2. Signal Strength

Defines how strongly a given data point proves that the user is a real builder, and can have 3 possible values: `weak`, `medium`, `strong.`

Examples:

- Winning a ETHGlobal hackathon is a strong signal that someone is a real builder.
- Simply having a GitHub account is a weak signal that someone is a real builder.

### 3. Max Score

Defines the maximum amount of points each Data Point can contribute to the overall Builder Score. We use the signal strength to help define the max score of each Data Point:

- strong (up to 40 points)
- medium (up to 20 points)
- weak ( to 8 points)

The mapping between signal strength and max score is just a framework for human decision, not enforced at the code level.

### 4. Multiplier

In the Builder Score, we use multipliers to convert the numerical value of a Data Point into a score measured in "points." These multipliers help standardize very different scales of Data Point values into a consistent scoring system.

Although we don't disclose the exact multipliers used for each Data Point, users can understand the relative importance of each Data Point through the signal strength and max score values we provide.

<details>
  <summary id="examples">Examples</summary>

- Data Point: Base Contracts Deployed (Mainnet)
  - Value: 7 (number of contracts deployed)
  - Multiplier: 0.2
  - Max Score: 2
  - Points: 1.4 (7\*0.2)
- Data Point: GitHub Total Contributions
  - Value: 1734
  - Multiplier: 0.001
  - Max Score: 15
  - Points: 1.734 (1734\*0.001)

</details>

:::warning

Builder Score is still experimental, so expect regular updates to its scoring formula.

:::

## Transparency and Formula Disclosure

At Talent Protocol, we believe in transparency while maintaining the integrity of our scoring system. We disclose the general framework of our Builder Score calculation, including:

- The Data Points we consider relevant
- The signal strength classification for each Data Point
- The maximum score potential for each Data Point

However, to prevent gaming or artificial optimization of the system, we do not publicly disclose:

- Specific multipliers for each Data Point
- Exact conversion functions applied to normalize values
- Detailed thresholds for achieving maximum scores

This approach allows us to maintain the integrity of the Builder Score while still providing users with clear guidance on how to improve their scores through genuine contributions.

## Summary

The Builder Score represents 3 core decisions:

1.  What Data Points are relevant to assess the reputation of a builder.
2.  How strongly does each Data Point signal that the user is a real builder.
3.  What should be the multiplier to convert each Data Point value into Builder Score points.

The final Builder Score is the sum of all the points.

Builder Score doesn’t have a maximum cap, so it’s likely to increase over time, as we add more integrations and possible credentials to the protocol.

## scoring-systems/creator-score.mdx
# Creator Score

A scoring system that identifies talent in content creation and creative contribution.

## What is the Creator Score?

Creator Score is a numerical value that represents a user's reputation as a content creator based on verified data across multiple platforms. Unlike traditional metrics that only consider follower count, Creator Score evaluates both quantity AND quality of creative output through verifiable signals.

The Creator Score is designed to:

- Help authentic creators gain recognition based on their actual contributions
- Provide protocols, brands, and platforms with reliable data to identify top creative talent
- Create a standardized measurement for creative impact and consistency
- Reward consistent, high-quality content creation over mere popularity

## Who is a Creator?

While Builder Score focuses on software development, Creator Score targets those who share original content consistently. A creator is someone that produces creative output (text, image, video, audio, interactive) that provides value to others by informing, educating, entertaining, or inspiring.

The Creator Score supports various creator types:

- **Visual Artists**: Illustrators, photographers, painters, graphic designers, animators
- **Writers**: Bloggers, journalists, essayists, poets, newsletter authors
- **Audio Creators**: Musicians, podcasters, sound designers, voice artists
- **Video Creators**: Filmmakers, vloggers, streamers, YouTube content producers
- **Community & Memes**: KOLs, meme artists, community builders

## Use Cases

Creator Score serves multiple purposes in the ecosystem:

- **For creators**: Objective verification of creative impact that can be shared across platforms
- **For protocols**: Reliable method to identify authentic creators for rewards, grants, and partnerships
- **For brands**: Data-driven discovery of talent for collaborations and sponsorships
- **For apps**: Enhanced context about users' creative contributions and reputation

## The "Creator Score" Scoring Framework

The Creator Score uses the same technical framework as the [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score) but with [data points](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point) specifically relevant to creators. The final score is the sum of all data point scores with no maximum cap, and each data point is evaluated based on: signal strength, max score, multiplier (not publicly disclosed), value conversion (optional).

### **Signal Strength**

- The first step is defining how strongly a given data point signals someone is a real creator
- There's 3 possible levels:
  - **Strong**: Up to 40 points (e.g., zora rewards earned)
  - **Medium**: Up to 20 points (e.g., farcaster followers)
  - **Weak**: Up to 8 points (e.g., twitter account age)

### **Max Score**

- Maximum amount of points each data point can contribute to the Creator Score, based on the signal strength

### **Multiplier**

- Each data point has a multiplier to convert its readable value into points
- The multiplier is not publicly disclosed to prevent gaming (same approach as Builder Score)
- Example: for twitter followers, if the multiplier is 0.01 and I have 1,000 followers, I will receive 10 points

### **Value Conversion**

- Some data point original values are converted to normalized metrics.
- Example: We us a square root function for metrics like total followers or NFT earnings to prevent large creators from completely dominating

## Creator Score Levels

Similar to Builder Score, Creator Score is organized into levels to help users understand their standing:

| Level | Score Range | Description                                                                            |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | 0-39        | Just getting started. Has created some content and taken first steps as a creator.     |
| 2     | 40-79       | Creating content regularly with growing engagement. Beginning to build an audience.    |
| 3     | 80-119      | Established creator with consistent output and meaningful engagement across platforms. |
| 4     | 120-169     | Accomplished creator with significant audience and proven monetization.                |
| 5     | 170-249     | Top-tier creator with substantial influence and recognition in their domain.           |
| 6     | 250+        | Elite creator with exceptional impact, audience, and earnings.                         |

## Key Metrics

The Creator Score considers various metrics organized into three categories:

### 1. Creation Metrics

- Content Published - total number of content pieces published
- Content Frequency - number of unique pieces published per week/month
- Publishing Streak - consecutive weeks/months with published content
- Creative Longevity - time since first published content

### 2. Engagement Metrics

- Followers and subscriber counts across platforms
- Follower-to-following ratio
- Engagement rates and interactions with content

### 3. Economic Metrics

- Total earnings and rewards
- Unique holders/collectors/paid subscribers
- NFT mints, coin purchases or price
- Secondary market activity (NFT/coin trading)
- Collector loyalty/repeat engagement

# Scoring Systems

A Scoring System is a set of rules that convert Data Points into numerical reputation scores.

A Scoring System assigns numerical scores (measured in "points") to a selection of [Data Points](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point).

Talent Protocol intentionally separates Data Points (objective data) from Scoring Systems (subjective data). Both are autonomous and composable protocol primitives.

## Different Scores

Multiple scoring systems can exist in parallel, with each designed to evaluate talent in a specific domain:

- [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score) identifies people creating software
- [Creator Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/creator-score) recognizes content and community builders
- Other scores coming soon

Each scoring system operates independently with its own set of relevant Data Points and scoring logic, tailored to what matters for their specific persona.

This modular approach allows Talent Protocol to serve different communities with metrics that genuinely reflect their unique contributions, rather than forcing diverse talents into the same box.

Reach out if you want to create a custom scoring system.

## Scoring Framework

A Scoring System is composed of:

1.  a **selection of Data Points** to be considered for this particular score
2.  a **value conversion** (optional) to normalize Data Point values (ex.`timestamp_to_year` or `sqrt)`
3.  a **signal strength** (strong, medium, or weak) attributed to each Data Point
4.  a **maximum score** (in "points") that each Data Point can contribute to the overall score
5.  a **scoring function** or **condition** that converts the current value of a Data Point into a numerical score (measured in "points")

Scoring systems are absolute, meaning they don’t include any form of normalization or percentile-based approach. The final score should be a simple sum of all Data Point individual scores.

This framework intends to keep every scoring system simple, transparent and scalable.

## Calculating a Score

To calculate a score, Talent Protocol will follow the steps below:

1.  Fetch new data for each account and store them in the respective Data Point.
2.  If the Data Point value changed, we create an [Event](/docs/protocol-concepts/event) (coming soon).
3.  We then apply the scoring framework to all Data Points with a value change.
4.  If there are multiple sources for the same data point (example: a user with multiples wallet addresses), we pick the one with the highest value.

## Score Credentials

A Score Credential is the connection between a [Data Point](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point) and a Scoring System. It defines:

1.  How much a specific Data Point contributes to a given score
2.  The criteria for evaluating the Data Point's value
3.  The maximum points this credential can add to the total score

## Example

For the Data Point "GitHub Stars":

- In the Builder Score system, this might be worth up to 15 points (strong signal)
- In the Creator Score system, this might be worth only 2 points (weak signal)

Similarly, for the Data Point "Zora Earnings":

- In the Creator Score system, this might be worth up to 30 points (strong signal)
- In the Builder Score system, this might be worth only 5 points (weak signal)

# Socials

Socials represent a builder's connected social media accounts and their associated data.

## What are Socials?

In Talent Protocol, a Social is a verified connection to a social platform like X/Twitter, Farcaster, Lens, or LinkedIn that:

- Provides additional context about a builder's reputation
- Contains metadata such as follower count, following count, and profile details
- Has been verified through OAuth or other verification methods

## Social Properties

Each Social connection includes:

- `source`: The platform (e.g., "lens", "farcaster", "github")
- `owner`: The account identifier on that platform
- `follower_count`: Number of followers
- `following_count`: Number of accounts followed
- `display_name`: Display name on that platform
- `name`: Username on the platform
- `profile_url`: Link to the social profile
- `image_url`: Profile picture URL
- `bio`: Profile description
- `location`: Location listed on the social platform
- `owned_since`: When the account was first verified

## Accessing Social Data

The [API](/docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference) provides dedicated endpoints to access a profile's social connections, allowing developers to:

- Verify cross-platform identity
- Assess social credibility
- Display social proof in applications

# User

A User represents an individual that signed up on talentprotocol.com

A **User** represents an individual that signed up on talentprotocol.com to verify their reputation data and increase their [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score), by connecting multiple [**accounts**](/docs/protocol-concepts/account)**.**

An [**Account**](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) represents a connection with a third-party entity (e.g., Wallet Address, GitHub, X, LinkedIn) that feeds reputation data into Talent Protocol. Accounts can exist independently or be linked to a user.

## Key Attributes:

- Each user has a unique identifier (UUID) in the Talent database, ensuring every user is distinct.
- Users have a single profile URL aggregating data from all associated accounts.
  - `talentprotocol.com/UUID`
- A user can connect multiple [accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account), but an account can only be linked to one user at a time.
- A user aggregates reputation data from all its connected [accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) into a unified [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score).
- A user is be able to sign-in to the Talent Protocol App with any account that they connected.
- For now, only the Talent Protocol app can create, update or delete users from the database. Ecosystem apps can only read data.

## Types of Users:

- **User**: when we mention the term "user", we're referring to all individuals who signed up at talentprotocol.com, even if they haven’t connected a wallet or other accounts yet.
- **Onchain User**: Users with a verified EVM address added to the onchain Talent Registry.
- **Verified User**: Users who have earned a [Human Checkmark](/docs/protocol-concepts/human-checkmark).
- **Paying User**: Users who have spent funds on Talent Protocol, via the app or smart contracts.
- **Private User**: Users hidden from the app and API outputs, but still present in the database.
