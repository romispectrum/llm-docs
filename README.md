2. Click on "Raw"
3. copy the url
4. use it in the IDE, which will index the file and use it as documentation
5.  Go to the Cursor chat and click on `@/Docs/+ Add new doc`
6.  Paste the URL
7.  Give docs a name, eg `react-native-paper-docs`
8.  You can tag the docs `@react-native-paper-docs` when you want the ide to look into it.

just open it and follow the steps described there
