# Combining compiled functions | Concrete

Combining compiled functions | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCombining compiled functionsThis document explains how to combine compiled functions in Concrete, focusing on scenarios where multiple functions need to work together seamlessly. The goal is to ensure that outputs from certain functions can be used as inputs for others without decryption, including in recursive functions.Concrete offers two methods to achieve this:Using the composable flag: This method is suitable when there is a single function. The composable flag allows the function to be compiled in a way that its output can be used as input for subsequent operations. For more details, refer to the composition documentation.Using Concrete modules: This method is ideal when dealing with multiple functions or when more control is needed over how outputs are reused as inputs. Concrete modules allow you to specify precisely how functions interact. For further information, see the modules documentation.PreviousExtensionsNextWith compositionLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Simulation | Concrete

*Source: concrete/execution-analysis.html*

Simulation | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSimulationThis document explains how to use simulation to speed up the development, enabling faster prototyping while accounting for the inherent probability of errors in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) execution.Using simulation for faster prototypingDuring development, the speed of homomorphic execution can be a blocker for fast prototyping. Although you can directly call the function you want to compile, this approach does not fully replicate FHE execution, which involves a certain probability of error (see Exactness).To overcome this issue, simulation is introduced: concrete import fhe
import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return (x + 1) ** 2
inputset = [np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(10,)) for _ in range(10)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset, p_error=0.1, fhe_simulation=True)
sample = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
actual = f(sample)
simulation = circuit.simulate(sample)
print(actual.tolist())
print(simulation.tolist())After the simulation runs, it prints the following results:[1, 4, 9, 16, 16, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]Overflow detection in simulationOverflow can happen during an FHE computation, leading to unexpected behaviors. Using simulation can help you detect these events by printing a warning whenever an overflow happens. This feature is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting detect_overflow_in_simulation=True during compilation.To demonstrate, we will compile the previous circuit with overflow detection enabled and trigger an overflow:circuit = f.compile(inputset, p_error=0.1, fhe_simulation=True, detect_overflow_in_simulation=True)
# Simulation | Concrete
circuit.simulate([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,15])You will see the following warning after the simulation call:If you look at the MLIR (circuit.mlir), you will see that the input type is supposed to be eint4 represented in 4 bits with a maximum value of 15. Since there's an addition of the input, we used the maximum value (15) here to trigger an overflow (15 + 1 = 16 which needs 5 bits). The warning specifies the operation that caused the overflow and its location. Similar warnings will be displayed for all basic FHE operations such as add, mul, and lookup tables.PreviousCommon errorsNextDebugging and artifactLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Compiler workflow | Concrete

Compiler workflow | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCompiler workflowThis document explains the different passes happening in the compilation process, from the Concrete Python frontend to the Concrete MLIR compiler.There are two main entry points to the Concrete Compiler. The first is to use the Concrete Python frontend. The second is to use the Compiler directly, which takes MLIR as input. Concrete Python is more high level and uses the Compiler under the hood.Compilation begins in the frontend with tracing to get an easy-to-manipulate representation of the function. We call this representation a Computation Graph, which is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) containing nodes representing computations done in the function. Working with graphs is useful because they have been studied extensively and there are a lot of available algorithms to manipulate them. Internally, we use networkx, which is an excellent graph library for Python.The next step in compilation is transforming the computation graph. There are many transformations we perform, and these are discussed in their own sections. The result of a transformation is another computation graph.After transformations are applied, we need to determine the bounds (i.e., the minimum and the maximum values) of each intermediate node. This is required because FHE allows limited precision for computations. Measuring these bounds helps determine the required precision for the function.The frontend is almost done at this stage and only needs to transform the computation graph to equivalent MLIR code. Once the MLIR is generated, our Compiler backend takes over. Any other frontend wishing to use the Compiler needs to plugin at this stage.The Compiler takes MLIR code that makes use of both the FHE and FHELinalg dialects for scalar and tensor operations respectively.Compilation then ends with a series of passes that generates a native binary which contains executable code. Crypto parameters are generated along the way as well.TracingWe start with a Python function f, such as this one: return (2 * x) + 3The goal of tracing is to create the following computation graph without requiring any change from the user.(Note that the edge labels are for non-commutative operations. To give an example, a subtraction node represents (predecessor with edge label 0) - (predecessor with edge label 1))To do this, we make use of Tracers, which are objects that record the operation performed during their creation. We create a Tracer for each argument of the function and call the function with those Tracers. Tracers make use of the operator overloading feature of Python to achieve their goal: return x + 2 * y
x = Tracer(computation=Input("x"))
y = Tracer(computation=Input("y"))
resulting_tracer = f(x, y)2 * y will be performed first, and * is overloaded for Tracer to return another tracer: Tracer(computation=Multiply(Constant(2), self.computation)), which is equal to Tracer(computation=Multiply(Constant(2), Input("y"))).x + (2 * y) will be performed next, and + is overloaded for Tracer to return another tracer: Tracer(computation=Add(self.computation, (2 * y).computation)), which is equal to Tracer(computation=Add(Input("x"), Multiply(Constant(2), Input("y"))).In the end, we will have output tracers that can be used to create the computation graph. The implementation is a bit more complex than this, but the idea is the same.Tracing is also responsible for indicating whether the values in the node would be encrypted or not. The rule for that is: if a node has an encrypted predecessor, it is encrypted as well.Topological transformsThe goal of topological transforms is to make more functions compilable.With the current version of Concrete, floating-point inputs and floating-point outputs are not supported. However, if the floating-point operations are intermediate operations, they can sometimes be fused into a single table lookup from integer to integer, thanks to some specific transforms.Let's take a closer look at the transforms we can currently perform.Fusing.We have allocated a whole new chapter to explaining fusing. You can find it here.Bounds measurementGiven a computation graph, the goal of the bounds measurement step is to assign the minimal data type to each node in the graph.If we have an encrypted input that is always between 0 and 10, we should assign the type EncryptedScalar<uint4> to the node of this input as EncryptedScalar<uint4>. This is the minimal encrypted integer that supports all values between 0 and 10.If there were negative values in the range, we could have used intX instead of uintX.Bounds measurement is necessary because FHE supports limited precision, and we don't want unexpected behaviour while evaluating the compiled functions.Let's take a closer look at how we perform bounds measurement.Inputset evaluationThis is a simple approach that requires an inputset to be provided by the user.The inputset is not to be confused with the dataset, which is classical in ML, as it doesn't require labels. Rather, the inputset is a set of values which are typical inputs of the function.The idea is to evaluate each input in the inputset and record the result of each operation in the computation graph. Then we compare the evaluation results with the current minimum/maximum values of each node and update the minimum/maximum accordingly. After the entire inputset is evaluated, we assign a data type to each node using the minimum and maximum values it contains.Here is an example, given this computation graph where x is encrypted:and this inputset:Evaluation result of 2:x: 22: 2*: 43: 3+: 7New bounds:x: [2, 2]2: [2, 2]*: [4, 4]3: [3, 3]+: [7, 7]Evaluation result of 3:x: 32: 2*: 63: 3+: 9New bounds:x: [2, 3]2: [2, 2]*: [4, 6]3: [3, 3]+: [7, 9]Evaluation result of 1:x: 12: 2*: 23: 3+: 5New bounds:x: [1, 3]2: [2, 2]*: [2, 6]3: [3, 3]+: [5, 9]Assigned data types:x: EncryptedScalar<uint2>2: ClearScalar<uint2>*: EncryptedScalar<uint3>3: ClearScalar<uint2>+: EncryptedScalar<uint4>MLIR Compiler PassesWe describe below some of the main passes in the compilation pipeline.FHE to TFHEThis pass converts high level operations which are not crypto specific to lower level operations from the TFHE scheme. Ciphertexts get introduced in the code as well. TFHE operations and ciphertexts require some parameters which need to be chosen, and the TFHE Parameterization pass does just that.TFHE ParameterizationTFHE Parameterization takes care of introducing the chosen parameters in the Intermediate Representation (IR). After this pass, you should be able to see the dimension of ciphertexts, as well as other parameters in the IR.TFHE to ConcreteThis pass lowers TFHE operations to low level operations that are closer to the backend implementation, working on tensors and memory buffers (after a bufferization pass).Concrete to LLVMThis pass lowers everything to LLVM-IR in order to generate the final binary.PreviousSupported operationsNextAdvanced featuresLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

When enabled, fhe function are computated in parallel in a background threads pool. When several run are composed, they are automatically synchronized.For now, it only works for the run method of a FheModule, in that case you obtain a Future[Value] immediately instead of a Value when computation is finished.E.g. my_module.f3.run( my_module.f1.run(a), my_module.f1.run(b) ) will runs f1 and f2 in parallel in the background and f3 in background when both f1 and f2 intermediate results are available.If you want to manually synchronize on the termination of a full computation, e.g. you want to return the encrypted result, you can call explicitely value.result() to wait for the result. To simplify testing, decryption does it automatically.Automatic scheduling behavior can be override locally by calling directly a variant of run:run_sync: forces the fhe function to occur in the current thread, not in the background,run_async: forces the fhe function to occur in a background thread, returning immediately a Future[Value]security_level: int = 128Set the level of security used to perform the optimization of crypto-parameters.PreviousFormatting and drawingNextManage keysLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Table Lookups basics | Concrete

Table Lookups basics | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageTable Lookups basicsThis document introduces the concept of Table Lookups (TLUs) in Concrete, covers the basic TLU usage, performance considerations, and some basic techniques for optimizing TLUs in encrypted computations. For more advanced TLU usage, refer to the Table Lookup advanced sectionIn TFHE, there exists mainly two operations: the linear operations, such as additions, subtractions, multiplications by integer, and the non-linear operations. Non-linear operations are achieved with Table Lookups (TLUs).PerformanceWhen using TLUs in Concrete, the most crucial factor for speed is the bit-width of the TLU. The smaller the bit width, the faster the corresponding FHE operation. Therefore, you should reduce the size of inputs to the lookup tables whenever possible. At the end of this document, we discuss methods for truncating or rounding entries to decrease the effective input size, further improving TLU performance.Direct TLUA direct TLU performs operations in the form of y = T[i], where T is a table and i is an index. You can define the table using fhe.LookupTable and apply it to scalars or tensors.Scalar lookup concrete import fhe
table = fhe.LookupTable([2, -1, 3, 0])
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[x]
inputset = range(4)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0) == table[0] == 2
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1) == table[1] == -1
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(2) == table[2] == 3
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(3) == table[3] == 0Tensor lookupimport numpy as np
table = fhe.LookupTable([2, -1, 3, 0])
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[x]
inputset = [np.random.randint(0, 4, size=(2, 3)) for _ in range(10)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
sample = [
[0, 1, 3],
[2, 3, 1],
]
expected_output = [
[2, -1, 0],
[3, 0, -1],
]
actual_output = circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(np.array(sample))
assert np.array_equal(actual_output, expected_output)The LookupTable behaves like Python's array indexing, where negative indices access elements from the end of the table.Multi TLUA multi TLU is used to apply different elements of the input to different tables (e.g., square the first column, cube the second column):import numpy as np
squared = fhe.LookupTable([i ** 2 for i in range(4)])
cubed = fhe.LookupTable([i ** 3 for i in range(4)])
table = fhe.LookupTable([
[squared, cubed],
[squared, cubed],
[squared, cubed],
])
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[x]
inputset = [np.random.randint(0, 4, size=(3, 2)) for _ in range(10)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
sample = [
[0, 1],
[2, 3],
[3, 0],
]
expected_output = [
[0, 1],
[4, 27],
[9, 0]
]
actual_output = circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(np.array(sample))
assert np.array_equal(actual_output, expected_output)Transparent TLUIn many cases, you won't need to define your own TLUs, as Concrete will set them for you.
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return x ** 2
inputset = range(4)
circuit = f.compile(inputset, show_mlir = True)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0) == 0
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1) == 1
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(2) == 4
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(3) == 9Note that this kind of TLU is compatible with the TLU options, particularly with rounding and truncating which are explained below.fhe.univariate and fhe.multivariate extensions are convenient ways to perform more complex operations as transparent TLUs.Optimizing input sizeReducing the bit size of TLU inputs is essential for execution efficiency, as mentioned in the previous performance section. One effective method is to replace the table lookup y = T[i] by some y = T'[i'], where i' only has the most significant bits of i and T' is a much shorter table. This approach can significantly speed up the TLU while maintaining acceptable accuracy in many applications, such as machine learning.In this section, we introduce two basic techniques: truncating or rounding. You can find more in-depth explanation and other advanced techniques of optimization in the TLU advanced documentation.TruncatingThe first option is to set i' as the truncation of i. In this method, we just take the most significant bits of i. This is done with fhe.truncate_bit_pattern.import numpy as np
table = fhe.LookupTable([i**2 for i in range(16)])
lsbs_to_remove = 1
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[fhe.truncate_bit_pattern(x, lsbs_to_remove)]
inputset = range(16)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for i in range(16):
rounded_i = int(i / 2**lsbs_to_remove) * 2**lsbs_to_remove
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(i) == rounded_i**2RoundingThe second option is to set i as the rounded value of i. In this method, we take the most significant bits of i and round up by 1 if the most significant ignored bit is 1. This is done with fhe.round_bit_pattern.However, this approach can be slightly more complex, as rounding might result in an index that exceeds the original table's bounds. To handle this, we expand the original table by one additional index:import numpy as np
table = fhe.LookupTable([i**2 for i in range(17)])
lsbs_to_remove = 1
def our_round(x):
float_part = x - np.floor(x)
if float_part < 0.5:
return int(np.floor(x))
return int(np.ceil(x))
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[fhe.round_bit_pattern(x, lsbs_to_remove)]
inputset = range(16)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for i in range(16):
rounded_i = our_round(i * 1.0 / 2**lsbs_to_remove) * 2**lsbs_to_remove
assert (
circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(i) == rounded_i**2
), f"Miscomputation {i=} {circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(i)} {rounded_i**2}"Approximate roundingFor further optimizations, the fhe.round_bit_pattern function has an exactness=fhe.Exactness.APPROXIMATE option, which allows for faster computations at the cost of minor differences between cleartext and encrypted results:import numpy as np
table = fhe.LookupTable([i**2 for i in range(17)])
lsbs_to_remove = 1
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[fhe.round_bit_pattern(x, lsbs_to_remove, exactness=fhe.Exactness.APPROXIMATE)]
inputset = range(16)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for i in range(16):
lower_i = np.floor(i * 1.0 / 2**lsbs_to_remove) * 2**lsbs_to_remove
upper_i = np.ceil(i * 1.0 / 2**lsbs_to_remove) * 2**lsbs_to_remove
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(i) in [
lower_i**2,
upper_i**2,
], f"Miscomputation {i=} {circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(i)} {[lower_i**2, upper_i**2]}"PreviousTerminologyNextNon-linear operationsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Cryptography basics | Concrete

Cryptography basics | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCryptography basicsThis document provides an overview of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to get you started with Concrete. For more comprehensive resources about FHE, visit the awesome Zama repo or fhe.org.Operations on encrypted valuesHomomorphic encryption allows computations on ciphertexts without revealing the underlying plaintexts. A scheme is considered fully homomorphic if it supports an unlimited number of additions and multiplications.Let xxx represent a plaintext and E[x]E[x]E[x] the corresponding ciphertext:Homomorphic addition: E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]E[x] + E[y] = E[x + y]E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]Homomorphic multiplication: E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]E[x] * E[y] = E[x * y]E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]Noise and BootstrapFHE encrypts data as LWE ciphertexts, represented visually as a bit vector. The encrypted message is located in the higher-order (yellow) bits, while the lower-order (gray) bits contain random noise that ensures the security of the ciphertext.Each operation on an encrypted value increases the noise, and if it becomes too large, it may overlap with the message and corrupt its value. To reduce the noise of a ciphertext, the Bootstrap operation generates a new ciphertext encrypting the same message, but with lower noise. This allows additional operations to be performed on the encrypted message.In typical FHE programs, operations are followed by a bootstrap, and this sequence repeats multiple times.Probability of ErrorThe amount of noise in a ciphertext is not as bounded as it may appear in the above illustration. As the errors are drawn randomly from a Gaussian distribution, they can be of varying size. This means that we need to be careful to ensure the noise terms do not affect the message bits. If the error terms do overflow into the message bits, this can cause an incorrect output (failure) when bootstrapping.The noise in a ciphertext isn't strictly bounded, as errors are drawn from a Gaussian distribution and vary in size. If the noise grows too large, it may corrupt the message bits, causing incorrect outputs during bootstrapping.In Concrete, the default failure probability is set to 1100000\frac{1}{100000}1000001​, meaning that 1 in every 100,000 executions may result in an error. Reducing this probability requires adjusting cryptographic parameters, potentially lowering performance. Conversely, allowing a higher probability of error may improve performance.Function evaluationWhile we’ve covered arithmetic operations, typical programs also involve functions (for example, maximum, minimum, square root). In TFHE, the Bootstrap operation can be enhanced with a Table Lookup, creating a Programmable Bootstrap (PBS).Concrete uses PBS to evaluate functions homomorphically:Homomorphic univariate function evaluation: f(E[x])=E[f(x)]f(E[x]) = E[f(x)]f(E[x])=E[f(x)]For example, consider a function (or circuit) that takes a 4 bits input variable and output the maximum value between a clear constant and the encrypted input:
def encrypted_max(x: uint4):
return np.maximum(5, x)This function could be turned into a table lookup: lut = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
return lut[x]The Lookup table lut being applied during the Programmable Bootstrap.PBS managementYou don't need to manage PBS operations manually, as they are handled automatically by Concrete during the compilation process. Each function evaluation is converted into a lookup table and evaluated via PBS.For example, if you inspect the MLIR code generated by the frontend, you’ll see the lookup table in the 4th line of the following output: func.func @main(%arg0: !FHE.eint<4>) -> !FHE.eint<4> {
%cst = arith.constant dense<[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]> : tensor<16xi64>
%0 = "FHE.apply_lookup_table"(%arg0, %cst) : (!FHE.eint<4>, tensor<16xi64>) -> !FHE.eint<4>
return %0 : !FHE.eint<4>
}
}There are 2 things to keep in mind about PBS:Input type constraints: PBS operations adds constraints on input type and thus limits the maximum bit-width supported in Concrete.PBS performance impact: PBS operations are costly, so minimizing the number of PBS can improve circuit performance. PBS cost also varies with input precision (for example, an 8-bit PBS is faster than a 16-bit PBS). To learn more about optimizing PBS, refer to the Optimization section.PreviousTaggingNextSecurityLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Frontend fusing | Concrete

Frontend fusing | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFrontend fusingThis document describes the concept of fusing, which is the act of combining multiple nodes into a single node, which is converted to a Table Lookup.How is it done?Code related to fusing is in the frontends/concrete-python/concrete/fhe/compilation/utils.py file. Fusing can be performed using the fuse function.Within fuse:We loop until there are no more subgraphs to fuse.Within each iteration: 2.1. We find a subgraph to fuse.2.2. We search for a terminal node that is appropriate for fusing.2.3. We crawl backwards to find the closest integer nodes to this node.2.4. If there is a single node as such, we return the subgraph from this node to the terminal node.2.5. Otherwise, we try to find the lowest common ancestor (lca) of this list of nodes.2.6. If an lca doesn't exist, we say this particular terminal node is not fusable, and we go back to search for another subgraph.2.7. Otherwise, we use this lca as the input of the subgraph and continue with subgraph node creation below.2.8. We convert the subgraph into a subgraph node by checking fusability status of the nodes of the subgraph in this step.2.9. We substitute the subgraph node to the original graph.LimitationsWith the current implementation, we cannot fuse subgraphs that depend on multiple encrypted values where those values don't have a common lca (e.g., np.round(np.sin(x) + np.cos(y))).PreviousSecurityNextContributingLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Security | Concrete

Security | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSecurityThis document describes some security concepts around FHE that can help you generate parameters that are both secure and correct.Parameter CurvesTo select secure cryptographic parameters for usage in Concrete, we utilize the Lattice-Estimator. In particular, we use the following workflow:Data AcquisitionFor a given value of (n,q=264,σ)(n, q = 2^{64}, \sigma)(n,q=264,σ) we obtain raw data from the Lattice Estimator, which ultimately leads to a security level λ\lambdaλ. All relevant attacks in the Lattice Estimator are considered.Increase the value of σ\sigmaσ, until the tuple (n,q=264,σ)(n, q = 2^{64}, \sigma)(n,q=264,σ) satisfies the target level of security λtarget\lambda_{target}λtarget​.Repeat for several values of nnn.Model Generation for λ=λtarget\lambda = \lambda_{target}λ=λtarget​.At this point, we have several sets of points {(n,q=264,σ)}\{(n, q = 2^{64}, \sigma)\}{(n,q=264,σ)} satisfying the target level of security λtarget\lambda_{target}λtarget​. From here, we fit a model to this raw data (σ\sigmaσ as a function of nnn).Model Verification.For each model, we perform a verification check to ensure that the values output from the function σ(n)\sigma(n)σ(n) provide the claimed level of security, λtarget\lambda_{target}λtarget​.These models are then used as input for Concrete, to ensure that the parameter space explored by the compiler attains the required security level. Note that we consider the RC.BDGL16 lattice reduction cost model within the Lattice Estimator. Therefore, when computing our security estimates, we use the call LWE.estimate(params, red_cost_model = RC.BDGL16) on the input parameter set params.The cryptographic parameters are chosen considering the IND-CPA security model, and are selected with a bootstrapping failure probability fixed by the user. In particular, it is assumed that the results of decrypted computations are not shared by the secret key owner with any third parties, as such an action can lead to leakage of the secret encryption key. If you are designing an application where decryptions must be shared, you will need to craft custom encryption parameters which are chosen in consideration of the IND-CPA^D security model [1].[1] Li, Baiyu, et al. “Securing approximate homomorphic encryption using differential privacy.” Annual International Cryptology Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022. https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/816.pdfUsageTo generate the raw data from the lattice estimator, use::by default, this script will generate parameter curves for {80, 112, 128, 192} bits of security, using log2(q)=64log_2(q) = 64log2​(q)=64.To compare the current curves with the output of the lattice estimator, use:this will compare the four curves generated above against the output of the version of the lattice estimator found in the third_party folder.To generate the associated cpp and rust code, use::further advanced options can be found inside the Makefile.ExampleTo look at the raw data gathered in step 1., we can look in the sage-object folder. These objects can be loaded in the following way using SageMath:entries are tuples of the form: (n,log2(q),log2(σ),λ)(n, log_2(q), log_2(\sigma), \lambda)(n,log2​(q),log2​(σ),λ). We can view individual entries via::(2366, 64.0, 4.0, 128.51)To view the interpolated curves we load the verified_curves.sobj object inside the sage-object folder.This object is a tuple containing the information required for the four security curves ({80, 112, 128, 192} bits of security). Looking at one of the entries:(-0.026599462343105267, 2.981543184145991, 128)Here we can see the linear model parameters (a=−0.026599462343105267,b=2.981543184145991)(a = -0.026599462343105267, b = 2.981543184145991)(a=−0.026599462343105267,b=2.981543184145991) along with the security level 128. This linear model can be used to generate secure parameters in the following way: for q=264q = 2^{64}q=264, if we have an LWE dimension of n=1536n = 1536n=1536, then the required noise size is:σ=a∗n+b=−37.85\sigma = a * n + b = -37.85σ=a∗n+b=−37.85This value corresponds to the logarithm of the relative error size. Using the parameter set (n,log(q),σ=264−37.85)(n, log(q), \sigma = 2^{64 - 37.85})(n,log(q),σ=264−37.85) in the Lattice Estimator confirms a 128-bit security level.PreviousCryptography basicsNextFrontend fusingLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Bitwise operations | Concrete

*Source: concrete/explanations/advanced-features/bitwise.html*

Bitwise operations | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresBitwise operationsThis document describes how comparisons are managed in Concrete, typically "AND", "OR", and so on. It covers different strategies to make the FHE computations faster, depending on the context.Bitwise operations are not native operations in Concrete, so they need to be implemented using existing native operations (i.e., additions, clear multiplications, negations, table lookups). Concrete offers two different implementations for performing bitwise operations.ChunkedThis is the most general implementation that can be used in any situation. The idea is:
# Bitwise operations | Concrete
lhs_chunks = [lhs.bits[0:4], lhs.bits[4:8]]
# Bitwise operations | Concrete
rhs_chunks = [rhs.bits[0:4], rhs.bits[4:8]]
# Bitwise operations | Concrete
packed_chunks = []
for lhs_chunk, rhs_chunk in zip(lhs_chunks, rhs_chunks):
shifted_lhs_chunk = lhs_chunk * 2**4 # (i.e., lhs_chunk << 4)
packed_chunks.append(shifted_lhs_chunk + rhs_chunk)
# Bitwise operations | Concrete
bitwise_table = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result_chunks = bitwise_table[packed_chunks]
# Bitwise operations | Concrete
result = np.sum(result_chunks)NotesSigned bitwise operations are not supported.The optimal chunk size is selected automatically to reduce the number of table lookups.Chunked bitwise operations result in at least 4 and at most 9 table lookups.It is used if no other implementation can be used.ProsCan be used with any integers.ConsVery expensive.Examplefrom concrete import fhe
def f(x, y):
return x & y
inputset = [
(np.random.randint(0, 2**4), np.random.randint(0, 2**4))

return %8 : !FHE.eint<4>
}
}Packing TrickThis implementation uses the fact that we can combine two values into a single value and apply a single table lookup to this combined value!There are two major problems with this implementation:packing requires the same bit-width across operands.packing requires the bit-width of at least x.bit_width + y.bit_width and that bit-width cannot exceed maximum TLU bit-width, which is 16 at the moment.What this means is if we are comparing uint3 and uint6, we need to convert both of them to uint9 in some way to do the packing and proceed with the TLU in 9-bits. There are 4 ways to achieve this behavior.Requirements1. fhe.BitwiseStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTEDThis strategy makes sure that during bit-width assignment, both operands are assigned the same bit-width, and that bit-width contains at least the amount of bits required to store pack(x, y). The idea is:result = bitwise_lut[pack(x_promoted_to_uint9, y_promoted_to_uint9)]ProsIt will always result in a single table lookup.ConsIt will significantly increase the bit-width of both operands and lock them to each other across the whole circuit, which can result in significant slowdowns if the operands are used in other costly operations.Examplefrom concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
bitwise_strategy_preference=fhe.BitwiseStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTED,
)
def f(x, y):
return x & y
inputset = [
(np.random.randint(0, 2**4), np.random.randint(0, 2**4))
for _ in range(100)
]
compiler = fhe.Compiler(f, {"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset, configuration, show_mlir=True)produces
// promotions ............ ............
func.func @main(%arg0: !FHE.eint<8>, %arg1: !FHE.eint<8>) -> !FHE.eint<4> {
// packing
%c16_i9 = arith.constant 16 : i9
%0 = "FHE.mul_eint_int"(%arg0, %c16_i9) : (!FHE.eint<8>, i9) -> !FHE.eint<8>
%1 = "FHE.add_eint"(%0, %arg1) : (!FHE.eint<8>, !FHE.eint<8>) -> !FHE.eint<8>
// computing the result
%cst = arith.constant dense<"..."> : tensor<256xi64>
%2 = "FHE.apply_lookup_table"(%1, %cst) : (!FHE.eint<8>, tensor<256xi64>) -> !FHE.eint<4>
return %2 : !FHE.eint<4>
}
}2. fhe.BitwiseStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTEDThis strategy will not put any constraint on bit-widths during bit-width assignment, instead operands are cast to a bit-width that can store pack(x, y) during runtime using table lookups. The idea is:x_cast_to_uint9 = uint3_to_uint9_lut[x]
uint6_to_uint9_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
y_cast_to_uint9 = uint6_to_uint9_lut[y]
bitwise_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result = bitwise_lut[pack(x_cast_to_uint9, y_cast_to_uint9)]NotesIt can result in a single table lookup as well, if x and y are assigned (because of other operations) the same bit-width, and that bit-width can store pack(x, y).Or in two table lookups if only one of the operands is assigned a bit-width bigger than or equal to the bit width that can store pack(x, y).ProsIt will not put any constraints on bit-widths of the operands, which is amazing if they are used in other costly operations.It will result in at most 3 table lookups, which is still good.ConsIf you are not doing anything else with the operands, or doing less costly operations compared to bitwise, it will introduce up to two unnecessary table lookups and slow down execution compared to fhe.BitwiseStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTED.Examplefrom concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
comparison_strategy_preference=fhe.BitwiseStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTED,
)

return %4 : !FHE.eint<4>
}
}3. fhe.BitwiseStrategy.TWO_TLU_BIGGER_PROMOTED_SMALLER_CASTEDThis strategy can be viewed as a middle ground between the two strategies described above. With this strategy, only the bigger operand will be constrained to have at least the required bit-width to store pack(x, y), and the smaller operand will be cast to that bit-width during runtime. The idea is:x_cast_to_uint9 = uint3_to_uint9_lut[x]
comparison_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result = comparison_lut[x_cast_to_uint9 - y_promoted_to_uint9]NotesIt can result in a single table lookup as well, if the smaller operand is assigned (because of other operations) the same bit-width as the bigger operand.ProsIt will only put a constraint on the bigger operand, which is great if the smaller operand is used in other costly operations.It will result in at most 2 table lookups, which is great.ConsIt will significantly increase the bit-width of the bigger operand which can result in significant slowdowns if the bigger operand is used in other costly operations.If you are not doing anything else with the smaller operand, or doing less costly operations compared to comparison, it could introduce an unnecessary table lookup and slow down execution compared to fhe.BitwiseStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTED.Examplefrom concrete import fhe

}4. fhe.BitwiseStrategy.TWO_TLU_BIGGER_CASTED_SMALLER_PROMOTEDThis strategy is like the exact opposite of the strategy above. With this, only the smaller operand will be constrained to have at least the required bit-width, and the bigger operand will be cast during runtime.

If you want the best runtime for your use case, you can compile your circuit with all different comparison strategy preferences, and pick the one with the lowest complexity.ShiftsThe same configuration option is used to modify the behavior of encrypted shift operations, and shifts are much more complex to implement, so we'll not go over the details. What is important is, that the end result is computed using additions or subtractions on the original shifted operand. Since additions and subtractions require the same bit-width across operands, input and output bit-widths need to be synchronized at some point. There are two ways to do this:With promotionHere, the shifted operand and shift result are assigned the same bit-width during bit-width assignment, which avoids an additional TLU on the shifted operand. On the other hand, it might increase the bit-width of the result or the shifted operand, and if they're used in other costly operations, it could result in significant slowdowns. This is the default behavior.from concrete import fhe

# Comparisons | Concrete

*Source: concrete/explanations/advanced-features/comparisons.html*

Comparisons | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresComparisonsThis document describes how comparisons are managed in Concrete, typically 'equal', 'greater than', and so on. It covers different strategies to make the FHE computations faster, depending on the context.Comparisons are not native operations in Concrete, so they need to be implemented using existing native operations (i.e., additions, clear multiplications, negations, table lookups). Concrete offers three different implementations for performing comparisons.ChunkedThis is the most general implementation that can be used in any situation. The idea is:
# Comparisons | Concrete
lhs_chunks = [lhs.bits[0:4], lhs.bits[4:8]]
# Comparisons | Concrete
rhs_chunks = [rhs.bits[0:4], rhs.bits[4:8]]
# Comparisons | Concrete
packed_chunks = []
for lhs_chunk, rhs_chunk in zip(lhs_chunks, rhs_chunks):
shifted_lhs_chunk = lhs_chunk * 2**4 # (i.e., lhs_chunk << 4)
packed_chunks.append(shifted_lhs_chunk + rhs_chunk)
# Comparisons | Concrete
comparison_table = fhe.LookupTable([...])
chunk_comparisons = comparison_table[packed_chunks]
# Comparisons | Concrete
result = chunk_comparisons[0]
for chunk_comparison in chunk_comparisons[1:]:
chunk_reduction_table = fhe.LookupTable([...])
shifted_chunk_comparison= chunk_comparison * 2**2 # (i.e., lhs_chunk << 2)
result = chunk_reduction_table[result + shifted_chunk_comparison]NotesSigned comparisons are more complex to explain, but they are supported!The optimal chunk size is selected automatically to reduce the number of table lookups.Chunked comparisons result in at least 5 and at most 13 table lookups.It is used if no other implementation can be used.== and != are using a different chunk comparison and reduction strategy with less table lookups.ProsCan be used with any integers.ConsVery expensive.Examplefrom concrete import fhe

}Subtraction TrickThis implementation uses the fact that x [<,<=,==,!=,>=,>] y is equal to x - y [<,<=,==,!=,>=,>] 0, which is just a subtraction and a table lookup!There are two major problems with this implementation:subtraction before the TLU requires up to 2 additional bits to avoid overflows (it is 1 in most cases).subtraction requires the same bit-width across operands.What this means is if we are comparing uint3 and uint6, we need to convert both of them to uint7 in some way to do the subtraction and proceed with the TLU in 7-bits. There are 4 ways to achieve this behavior.Requirements1. fhe.ComparisonStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTEDThis strategy makes sure that during bit-width assignment, both operands are assigned the same bit-width, and that bit-width contains at least the number of bits required to store x - y. The idea is:result = comparison_lut[x_promoted_to_uint7 - y_promoted_to_uint7]ProsIt will always result in a single table lookup.ConsIt will increase the bit-width of both operands and lock them to each other across the whole circuit, which can result in significant slowdowns if the operands are used in other costly operations.Examplefrom concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
comparison_strategy_preference=fhe.ComparisonStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTED,
)
def f(x, y):
return x < y
inputset = [
(np.random.randint(0, 2**4), np.random.randint(0, 2**4))
for _ in range(100)
]
compiler = fhe.Compiler(f, {"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset, configuration, show_mlir=True)produces // promotions ............ ............
func.func @main(%arg0: !FHE.eint<5>, %arg1: !FHE.eint<5>) -> !FHE.eint<1> {
// subtraction
%0 = "FHE.to_signed"(%arg0) : (!FHE.eint<5>) -> !FHE.esint<5>
%1 = "FHE.to_signed"(%arg1) : (!FHE.eint<5>) -> !FHE.esint<5>
%2 = "FHE.sub_eint"(%0, %1) : (!FHE.esint<5>, !FHE.esint<5>) -> !FHE.esint<5>
// computing the result
%cst = arith.constant dense<[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]> : tensor<32xi64>
%3 = "FHE.apply_lookup_table"(%2, %cst) : (!FHE.esint<5>, tensor<32xi64>) -> !FHE.eint<1>
return %3 : !FHE.eint<1>
}
}2. fhe.ComparisonStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTEDThis strategy will not put any constraint on bit-widths during bit-width assignment, instead operands are cast to a bit-width that can store x - y during runtime using table lookups. The idea is:x_cast_to_uint7 = uint3_to_uint7_lut[x]
uint6_to_uint7_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
y_cast_to_uint7 = uint6_to_uint7_lut[y]
comparison_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result = comparison_lut[x_cast_to_uint7 - y_cast_to_uint7]NotesIt can result in a single table lookup, if x and y are assigned (because of other operations) the same bit-width and that bit-width can store x - y.Alternatively, two table lookups can be used if only one of the operands is assigned a bit-width bigger than or equal to the bit width that can store x - y.ProsIt will not put any constraints on the bit-widths of the operands, which is amazing if they are used in other costly operations.It will result in at most 3 table lookups, which is still good.ConsIf you are not doing anything else with the operands, or doing less costly operations compared to comparison, it will introduce up to two unnecessary table lookups and slow down execution compared to fhe.ComparisonStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTED.Examplefrom concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
comparison_strategy_preference=fhe.ComparisonStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTED,

}3. fhe.ComparisonStrategy.TWO_TLU_BIGGER_PROMOTED_SMALLER_CASTEDThis strategy can be seen as a middle ground between the two strategies described above. With this strategy, only the bigger operand will be constrained to have at least the required bit-width to store x - y, and the smaller operand will be cast to that bit-width during runtime. The idea is:x_cast_to_uint7 = uint3_to_uint7_lut[x]
comparison_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result = comparison_lut[x_cast_to_uint7 - y_promoted_to_uint7]NotesIt can result in a single table lookup, if the smaller operand is assigned (because of other operations) the same bit-width as the bigger operand.ProsIt will only put a constraint on the bigger operand, which is great if the smaller operand is used in other costly operations.It will result in at most 2 table lookups, which is great.ConsIt will increase the bit-width of the bigger operand, which can result in significant slowdowns if the bigger operand is used in other costly operations.If you are not doing anything else with the smaller operand, or doing less costly operations compared to comparison, it could introduce an unnecessary table lookup and slow down execution compared to fhe.ComparisonStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTED.Examplefrom concrete import fhe

}
}Clipping TrickThis implementation uses the fact that the subtraction trick is not optimal in terms of the required intermediate bit width. The comparison result does not change if we compare(3, 40) or compare(3, 4), so why not clipping the bigger operand and then doing the subtraction to use less bits!There are two major problems with this implementation:it can not be used when the bit-widths are the same (for some cases even when they differ by only one bit)subtraction still requires the same bit-width across operands.What this means is if we are comparing uint3 and uint6, we need to convert both of them to uint4 in some way to do the subtraction and proceed with the TLU in 7-bits. There are 2 ways to achieve this behavior.Requirementsbigger = x if x.bit_width > y.bit_width else y
clipped = lambda value: np.clip(value, smaller.min() - 1, smaller.max() + 1)
any(
(
bit_width <= MAXIMUM_TLU_BIT_WIDTH and
bit_width <= bigger.dtype.bit_width and
bit_width > smaller.dtype.bit_width
)
for bit_width in [
(smaller - clipped(bigger)).bit_width,
(clipped(bigger) - smaller).bit_width,
]
)1. fhe.ComparisonStrategy.THREE_TLU_BIGGER_CLIPPED_SMALLER_CASTEDThis strategy will not put any constraint on bit-widths during bit-width assignment, instead the smaller operand is cast to a bit-width that can store clipped(bigger) - smaller or smaller - clipped(bigger) during runtime using table lookups. The idea is:x_cast_to_uint4 = uint3_to_uint4_lut[x]
clipper = fhe.LookupTable([...])
y_clipped = clipper[y]
comparison_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result = comparison_lut[x_cast_to_uint4 - y_clipped]
# Comparisons | Concrete
another_comparison_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result = another_comparison_lut[y_clipped - x_cast_to_uint4]NotesThis is a fallback implementation, so if there is a difference of 1-bit (or in some cases 2-bits) and the subtraction trick cannot be used optimally, this implementation will be used instead of fhe.ComparisonStrategy.CHUNKED.It can result in two table lookups if the smaller operand is assigned a bit-width bigger than or equal to the bit width that can store clipped(bigger) - smaller or smaller - clipped(bigger).ProsIt will not put any constraints on the bit-widths of the operands, which is amazing if they are used in other costly operations.It will result in at most 3 table lookups, which is still good.These table lookups will be on smaller bit-widths, which is great.ConsCannot be used to compare integers with the same bit-width, which is very common.Examplefrom concrete import fhe

}2. fhe.ComparisonStrategy.TWO_TLU_BIGGER_CLIPPED_SMALLER_PROMOTEDThis strategy is similar to the strategy described above. The difference is that with this strategy, the smaller operand will be constrained to have at least the required bit-width to store clipped(bigger) - smaller or smaller - clipped(bigger). The bigger operand will still be clipped to that bit-width during runtime. The idea is:y_clipped = clipper[y]

# Comparisons | Concrete
another_comparison_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])

# Direct circuits | Concrete

Direct circuits | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresDirect circuitsThis document explains the concept of direct circuits in Concrete, which is another way to compile circuit without having to give a proper inputset.Direct circuits are still experimental. It is very easy to make mistakes (e.g., due to no overflow checks or type coercion) while using direct circuits, so utilize them with care.For some applications, the data types of inputs, intermediate values, and outputs are known (e.g., for manipulating bytes, you would want to use uint8). Using inputsets to determine bounds in these cases is not necessary, and can even be error-prone. Therefore, another interface for defining such circuits is introduced: concrete import fhe
@fhe.circuit({"x": "encrypted"})
def circuit(x: fhe.uint8):
return x + 42
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(10) == 52There are a few differences between direct circuits and traditional circuits:Remember that the resulting dtype for each operation will be determined by its inputs. This can lead to some unexpected results if you're not careful (e.g., if you do -x where x: fhe.uint8, you won't receive a negative value as the result will be fhe.uint8 as well)There is no inputset evaluation when using fhe types in .astype(...) calls (e.g., np.sqrt(x).astype(fhe.uint4)), so the bit width of the output cannot be determined.Specify the resulting data type in univariate extension (e.g., fhe.univariate(function, outputs=fhe.uint4)(x)), for the same reason as above.Be careful with overflows. With inputset evaluation, you'll get bigger bit widths but no overflows. With direct definition, you must ensure that there aren't any overflows manually.Let's review a more complicated example to see how direct circuits behave: concrete import fhe
import numpy as np
def square(value):
return value ** 2
@fhe.circuit({"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
def circuit(x: fhe.uint8, y: fhe.int2):
a = x + 10
b = y + 10
c = np.sqrt(a).round().astype(fhe.uint4)
d = fhe.univariate(square, outputs=fhe.uint8)(b)
return d - c
print(circuit)This prints:%1 = y # EncryptedScalar<int2>
%2 = 10 # ClearScalar<uint4>
%3 = add(%0, %2) # EncryptedScalar<uint8>
%4 = 10 # ClearScalar<uint4>
%5 = add(%1, %4) # EncryptedScalar<int4>
%6 = subgraph(%3) # EncryptedScalar<uint4>
%7 = square(%5) # EncryptedScalar<uint8>
%8 = subtract(%7, %6) # EncryptedScalar<uint8>
return %8
Subgraphs:
%6 = subgraph(%3):
%0 = input # EncryptedScalar<uint8>
%1 = sqrt(%0) # EncryptedScalar<float64>
%2 = around(%1, decimals=0) # EncryptedScalar<float64>
%3 = astype(%2) # EncryptedScalar<uint4>
return %3Here is the breakdown of the assigned data types:%1 is int2 because it's specified in the definition
%2 is uint4 because it's the constant 10
%3 is uint8 because it's the addition between uint8 and uint4
%4 is uint4 because it's the constant 10
%5 is int4 because it's the addition between int2 and uint4
%6 is uint4 because it's specified in astype
%7 is uint8 because it's specified in univariate
%8 is uint8 because it's subtraction between uint8 and uint4As you can see, %8 is subtraction of two unsigned values, and the result is unsigned as well. In the case that c > d, we have an overflow, and this results in undefined behavior.PreviousBitwise operationsNextTaggingLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Floating points | Concrete

Floating points | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresFloating pointsThis document describes how floating points are treated and manipulated in Concrete.Concrete partly supports floating points. There is no support for floating point inputs or outputs. However, there is support for intermediate values to be floating points (under certain constraints). Also, we note that one can use an equivalent of fixed points in Concrete, as described in our tutorial.Floating points as intermediate valuesConcrete-Compile, which is used for compiling the circuit, doesn't support floating points at all. However, it supports table lookups which take an integer and map it to another integer. The constraints of this operation are that there should be a single integer input, and a single integer output.As long as your floating point operations comply with those constraints, Concrete automatically converts them to a table lookup operation: concrete import fhe
import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
a = x + 1.5
b = np.sin(x)
c = np.around(a + b)
d = c.astype(np.int64)
return d
inputset = range(8)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for x in range(8):
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(x) == f(x)In the example above, a, b, and c are floating point intermediates. They are used to calculate d, which is an integer with a value dependent upon x, which is also an integer. Concrete detects this and fuses all of these operations into a single table lookup from x to d.This approach works for a variety of use cases, but it comes up short for others:import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
def f(x, y):
a = x + 1.5
b = np.sin(y)
c = np.around(a + b)
d = c.astype(np.int64)
return d
inputset = [(1, 2), (3, 0), (2, 2), (1, 3)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for x in range(8):
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(x) == f(x)This results in:
%0 = x # EncryptedScalar<uint2>
%1 = 1.5 # ClearScalar<float64>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ only integer constants are supported
%2 = y # EncryptedScalar<uint2>
%3 = add(%0, %1) # EncryptedScalar<float64>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ only integer operations are supported
%4 = sin(%2) # EncryptedScalar<float64>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ only integer operations are supported
%5 = add(%3, %4) # EncryptedScalar<float64>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ only integer operations are supported
%6 = around(%5) # EncryptedScalar<float64>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ only integer operations are supported
%7 = astype(%6, dtype=int_) # EncryptedScalar<uint3>
return %7The reason for the error is that d no longer depends solely on x; it depends on y as well. Concrete cannot fuse these operations, so it raises an exception instead.PreviousTruncatingNextComparisonsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Min/Max operations | Concrete

*Source: concrete/explanations/advanced-features/minmax.html*

Min/Max operations | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresMin/Max operationsThis document explains how to compute minimum and maximum between values in Concrete, covering different strategies to make computations faster, depending on the strategy.Finding the minimum or maximum of two numbers is not a native operation in Concrete, so it needs to be implemented using existing native operations (i.e., additions, clear multiplications, negations, table lookups). Concrete offers two different implementations for this.ChunkedThis is the most general implementation that can be used in any situation. The idea is:
# Min/Max operations | Concrete
select_lhs = lhs < rhs # or lhs > rhs for maximum
# Min/Max operations | Concrete
lhs_contribution = lhs * select_lhs
# Min/Max operations | Concrete
rhs_contribution = rhs * (1 - select_lhs)
# Min/Max operations | Concrete
result = lhs_contribution + rhs_contributionNotesInitial comparison is chunked as well, which is already very expensive.Multiplication with operands aren't allowed to increase the bit-width of the inputs, so they are very expensive as well.Optimal chunk size is selected automatically to reduce the number of table lookups.Chunked comparisons result in at least 9 and at most 21 table lookups.It is used if no other implementation can be used.ProsCan be used with any integers.ConsExtremely expensive.Examplefrom concrete import fhe

}
}Min/Max TrickThis implementation uses the fact that [min,max](x, y) is equal to [min, max](x - y, 0) + y, which is just a subtraction, a table lookup and an addition!There are two major problems with this implementation though:subtraction before the TLU requires up to 2 additional bits to avoid overflows (it is 1 in most cases).subtraction and addition require the same bit-width across operands.What this means is that if we are comparing uint3 and uint6, we need to convert both of them to uint7 in some way to do the subtraction and proceed with the TLU in 7-bits. There are 2 ways to achieve this behavior.Requirements1. fhe.MinMaxStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTEDThis strategy makes sure that during bit-width assignment, both operands are assigned the same bit-width, and that bit-width contains at least the amount of bits required to store x - y. The idea is:result = comparison_lut[x_promoted_to_uint7 - y_promoted_to_uint7] + y_promoted_to_uint7ProsIt will always result in a single table lookup.ConsIt will increase the bit-width of both operands and the result, and lock them together across the whole circuit, which can result in significant slowdowns if the result or the operands are used in other costly operations.Examplefrom concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
min_max_strategy_preference=fhe.MinMaxStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTED,
)
def f(x, y):
return np.minimum(x, y)
inputset = [
(np.random.randint(0, 2**4), np.random.randint(0, 2**2))
for _ in range(100)
]
compiler = fhe.Compiler(f, {"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset, configuration, show_mlir=True)produces
// promotions ............ ............
func.func @main(%arg0: !FHE.eint<5>, %arg1: !FHE.eint<5>) -> !FHE.eint<5> {
// subtraction
%0 = "FHE.to_signed"(%arg0) : (!FHE.eint<5>) -> !FHE.esint<5>
%1 = "FHE.to_signed"(%arg1) : (!FHE.eint<5>) -> !FHE.esint<5>
%2 = "FHE.sub_eint"(%0, %1) : (!FHE.esint<5>, !FHE.esint<5>) -> !FHE.esint<5>
// tlu
%cst = arith.constant dense<[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1]> : tensor<32xi64>
%3 = "FHE.apply_lookup_table"(%2, %cst) : (!FHE.esint<5>, tensor<32xi64>) -> !FHE.eint<5>
// addition
%4 = "FHE.add_eint"(%3, %arg1) : (!FHE.eint<5>, !FHE.eint<5>) -> !FHE.eint<5>
return %4 : !FHE.eint<5>
}
}2. fhe.MinMaxStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTEDThis strategy will not put any constraint on bit-widths during bit-width assignment. Instead, operands are cast to a bit-width that can store x - y during runtime using table lookups. The idea is:x_cast_to_uint7 = uint3_to_uint7_lut[x]
uint6_to_uint7_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
y_cast_to_uint7 = uint6_to_uint7_lut[y]
comparison_lut = fhe.LookupTable([...])
result = comparison_lut[x_cast_to_uint7 - y_cast_to_uint7] + yNotesIt can result in a single table lookup as well, if x and y are assigned (because of other operations) the same bit-width, and that bit-width can store x - y.Or in two table lookups if only one of the operands is assigned a bit-width bigger than or equal to the bit width that can store x - y.ProsIt will not put any constraints on bit-widths of the operands, which is amazing if they are used in other costly operations.It will result in at most 3 table lookups, which is still good.ConsIf you are not doing anything else with the operands, or doing less costly operations compared to comparison, it will introduce up to two unnecessary table lookups and slow down execution compared to fhe.MinMaxStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTED.Examplefrom concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
min_max_strategy_preference=fhe.MinMaxStrategy.THREE_TLU_CASTED,

# Rounding | Concrete

Rounding | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresRoundingThis document details the concept of rounding, and how it is used in Concrete to make some FHE computations especially faster.Table lookups have a strict constraint on the number of bits they support. This can be limiting, especially if you don't need exact precision. As well as this, using larger bit-widths leads to slower table lookups.To overcome these issues, rounded table lookups are introduced. This operation provides a way to round the least significant bits of a large integer and then apply the table lookup on the resulting (smaller) value.Imagine you have a 5-bit value, but you want to have a 3-bit table lookup. You can call fhe.round_bit_pattern(input, lsbs_to_remove=2) and use the 3-bit value you receive as input to the table lookup.Let's see how rounding works in practice: matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from concrete import fhe
original_bit_width = 5
lsbs_to_remove = 2
assert 0 < lsbs_to_remove < original_bit_width
original_values = list(range(2**original_bit_width))

fhe.round_bit_pattern(value, lsbs_to_remove)
for value in original_values
]
previous_rounded = rounded_values[0]
for original, rounded in zip(original_values, rounded_values):
if rounded != previous_rounded:
previous_rounded = rounded
print()
original_binary = np.binary_repr(original, width=(original_bit_width + 1))
rounded_binary = np.binary_repr(rounded, width=(original_bit_width + 1))
print(
f"{original:2} = 0b_{original_binary[:-lsbs_to_remove]}[{original_binary[-lsbs_to_remove:]}] "
f"=> "
f"0b_{rounded_binary[:-lsbs_to_remove]}[{rounded_binary[-lsbs_to_remove:]}] = {rounded}"
)

31 = 0b_0111[11] => 0b_1000[00] = 32and displays:If the rounded number is one of the last 2**(lsbs_to_remove - 1) numbers in the input range [0, 2**original_bit_width), an overflow will happen.By default, if an overflow is encountered during inputset evaluation, bit-widths will be adjusted accordingly. This results in a loss of speed, but ensures accuracy.You can turn this overflow protection off (e.g., for performance) by using fhe.round_bit_pattern(..., overflow_protection=False). However, this could lead to unexpected behavior at runtime.Now, let's see how rounding can be used in FHE.import time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
enable_unsafe_features=True,
use_insecure_key_cache=True,
insecure_key_cache_location=".keys",

)
input_bit_width = 6
input_range = np.array(range(2**input_bit_width))
timings = {}
results = {}
for lsbs_to_remove in range(input_bit_width):
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.round_bit_pattern(x, lsbs_to_remove) ** 2
circuit = f.compile(inputset=[input_range], configuration=configuration)
circuit.keygen()
encrypted_sample = circuit.encrypt(input_range)
start = time.time()
encrypted_result = circuit.run(encrypted_sample)
end = time.time()
result = circuit.decrypt(encrypted_result)
took = end - start
timings[lsbs_to_remove] = took
results[lsbs_to_remove] = result
number_of_figures = len(results)
columns = 1
for i in range(2, number_of_figures):
if number_of_figures % i == 0:
columns = i
rows = number_of_figures // columns
fig, axs = plt.subplots(rows, columns)
axs = axs.flatten()
baseline = timings[0]
for lsbs_to_remove in range(input_bit_width):
timing = timings[lsbs_to_remove]
speedup = baseline / timing
print(f"lsbs_to_remove={lsbs_to_remove} => {speedup:.2f}x speedup")
axs[lsbs_to_remove].set_title(f"lsbs_to_remove={lsbs_to_remove}")
axs[lsbs_to_remove].plot(input_range, results[lsbs_to_remove])
plt.show()prints:lsbs_to_remove=1 => 1.20x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=2 => 2.17x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=3 => 3.75x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=4 => 2.64x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=5 => 2.61x speedupThese speed-ups can vary from system to system.The reason why the speed-up is not increasing with lsbs_to_remove is because the rounding operation itself has a cost: each bit removal is a PBS. Therefore, if a lot of bits are removed, rounding itself could take longer than the bigger TLU which is evaluated afterwards.and displays:Feel free to disable overflow protection and see what happens.Auto RoundersRounding is very useful but, in some cases, you don't know how many bits your input contains, so it's not reliable to specify lsbs_to_remove manually. For this reason, the AutoRounder class is introduced.AutoRounder allows you to set how many of the most significant bits to keep, but they need to be adjusted using an inputset to determine how many of the least significant bits to remove. This can be done manually using fhe.AutoRounder.adjust(function, inputset), or by setting auto_adjust_rounders configuration to True during compilation.Here is how auto rounders can be used in FHE:import time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from concrete import fhe
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
enable_unsafe_features=True,
use_insecure_key_cache=True,
insecure_key_cache_location=".keys",

speedup = baseline / timing

plt.show()prints:target_msbs=5 => 1.22x speedup

target_msbs=3 => 3.11x speedup
target_msbs=2 => 2.23x speedup
target_msbs=1 => 2.34x speedupand displays:AutoRounders should be defined outside the function that is being compiled. They are used to store the result of the adjustment process, so they shouldn't be created each time the function is called. Furthermore, each AutoRounder should be used with exactly one round_bit_pattern call.ExactnessOne use of rounding is doing faster computation by ignoring the lower significant bits. For this usage, you can even get faster results if you accept the rounding it-self to be slightly inexact. The speedup is usually around 2x-3x but can be higher for big precision reduction. This also enable higher precisions values that are not possible otherwise.*Using the default configuration in approximate mode. For 3, 4, 5 and 6 reduced precision bits and accumulator precision up to 32bitsYou can turn on this mode either globally on the configuration: ...
rounding_exactness=fhe.Exactness.APPROXIMATE
)or on/off locally:v = fhe.round_bit_pattern(v, lsbs_to_remove=2, exactness=fhe.Exactness.EXACT)In approximate mode the rounding threshold up or down is not perfectly centered: The off-centering is:is bounded, i.e. at worst an off-by-one on the reduced precision value compared to the exact result,is pseudo-random, i.e. it will be different on each call,almost symmetrically distributed,depends on cryptographic properties like the encryption mask, the encryption noise and the crypto-parameters.In blue the exact value, the red dots are approximate values due to off-centered transition in approximate mode.Histogram of transitions off-centering delta. Each count correspond to a specific random mask and a specific encryption noise.Approximate rounding featuresWith approximate rounding, you can enable an approximate clipping to get further improved performance in the case of overflow handling. Approximate clipping enable to discard the extra bit of overflow protection bit in the successor TLU. For consistency a logical clipping is available when this optimization is not suitable.Logical clippingWhen fast approximate clipping is not suitable (i.e. slower), it's better to apply logical clipping for consistency and better resilience to code change. It has no extra cost since it's fuzed with the successor TLU.Only the last step is clipped.Approximate clippingThis set the first precision where approximate clipping is enabled, starting from this precision, an extra small precision TLU is introduced to safely remove the extra precision bit used to contain overflow. This way the successor TLU is faster. E.g. for a rounding to 7bits, that finishes to a TLU of 8bits due to overflow, forcing to use a TLU of 7bits is 3x faster.The last steps are decreased.PreviousTable Lookups advancedNextTruncatingLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

For a simpler guide, refer to the Table Lookup Basics.One of the most common operations in Concrete are Table Lookups (TLUs). All operations except addition, subtraction, multiplication with non-encrypted values, tensor manipulation operations, and a few operations built with those primitive operations (e.g. matmul, conv) are converted to Table Lookups under the hood.Table Lookups are very flexible. They allow Concrete to support many operations, but they are expensive. The exact cost depends on many variables (hardware used, error probability, etc.), but they are always much more expensive compared to other operations. You should try to avoid them as much as possible. It's not always possible to avoid them completely, but you might remove the number of TLUs or replace some of them with other primitive operations.Concrete automatically parallelizes TLUs if they are applied to tensors.Direct table lookupConcrete provides a LookupTable class to create your own tables and apply them in your circuits.LookupTables can have any number of elements. Let's call the number of elements N. As long as the lookup variable is within the range [-N, N), the Table Lookup is valid.If you go outside of this range, you will receive the following error:With scalars.You can create the lookup table using a list of integers and apply it using indexing: concrete import fhe
table = fhe.LookupTable([2, -1, 3, 0])
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[x]
inputset = range(4)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0) == table[0] == 2
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1) == table[1] == -1
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(2) == table[2] == 3
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(3) == table[3] == 0With tensors.When you apply a table lookup to a tensor, the scalar table lookup is applied to each element of the tensor:import numpy as np
table = fhe.LookupTable([2, -1, 3, 0])
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[x]
inputset = [np.random.randint(0, 4, size=(2, 3)) for _ in range(10)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
sample = [
[0, 1, 3],
[2, 3, 1],
]
expected_output = [
[2, -1, 0],
[3, 0, -1],
]
actual_output = circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(np.array(sample))
for i in range(2):
for j in range(3):
assert actual_output[i][j] == expected_output[i][j] == table[sample[i][j]]With negative values.LookupTable mimics array indexing in Python, which means if the lookup variable is negative, the table is looked up from the back:
table = fhe.LookupTable([2, -1, 3, 0])
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[-x]
inputset = range(1, 5)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1) == table[-1] == 0
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(2) == table[-2] == 3
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(3) == table[-3] == -1
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(4) == table[-4] == 2Direct multi-table lookupIf you want to apply a different lookup table to each element of a tensor, you can have a LookupTable of LookupTables:import numpy as np
squared = fhe.LookupTable([i ** 2 for i in range(4)])
cubed = fhe.LookupTable([i ** 3 for i in range(4)])
table = fhe.LookupTable([
[squared, cubed],
[squared, cubed],
[squared, cubed],
])
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return table[x]
inputset = [np.random.randint(0, 4, size=(3, 2)) for _ in range(10)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
sample = [
[0, 1],
[2, 3],
[3, 0],
]
expected_output = [
[0, 1],
[4, 27],
[9, 0]
]
actual_output = circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(np.array(sample))
for i in range(3):
for j in range(2):
if j == 0:
assert actual_output[i][j] == expected_output[i][j] == squared[sample[i][j]]
else:
assert actual_output[i][j] == expected_output[i][j] == cubed[sample[i][j]]In this example, we applied a squared table to the first column and a cubed table to the second column.Fused table lookupConcrete tries to fuse some operations into table lookups automatically so that lookup tables don't need to be created manually:import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return (42 * np.sin(x)).astype(np.int64) // 10
inputset = range(8)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for x in range(8):
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(x) == f(x)All lookup tables need to be from integers to integers. So, without .astype(np.int64), Concrete will not be able to fuse.The function is first traced into:Concrete then fuses appropriate nodes:Fusing makes the code more readable and easier to modify, so try to utilize it over manual LookupTables as much as possible.Using automatically created table lookupWe refer the users to this page for explanations about fhe.univariate(function) and fhe.multivariate(function) features, which are convenient ways to use automatically created table lookup.Table lookup exactnessTLUs are performed with an FHE operation called Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS). PBSs have a certain probability of error: when these errors happen, it results in inaccurate results.Let's say you have the table:And you perform a Table Lookup using 4. The result you should get is lut[4] = 16, but because of the possibility of error, you could get any other value in the table.The probability of this error can be configured through the p_error and global_p_error configuration options. The difference between these two options is that, p_error is for individual TLUs but global_p_error is for the whole circuit.If you set p_error to 0.01, for example, it means every TLU in the circuit will have a 99% chance (or more) of being exact. If there is a single TLU in the circuit, it corresponds to global_p_error = 0.01 as well. But if we have 2 TLUs, then global_p_error would be higher: that's 1 - (0.99 * 0.99) ~= 0.02 = 2%.If you set global_p_error to 0.01, the whole circuit will have at most 1% probability of error, no matter how many Table Lookups are included (which means that p_error will be smaller than 0.01 if there are more than a single TLU).If you set both of them, both will be satisfied. Essentially, the stricter one will be used.By default, both p_error and global_p_error are set to None, which results in a global_p_error of 1 / 100_000 being used.Feel free to play with these configuration options to pick the one best suited for your needs! See How to Configure to learn how you can set a custom p_error and/or global_p_error.Configuring either of those variables impacts compilation and execution times (compilation, keys generation, circuit execution) and space requirements (size of the keys on disk and in memory). Lower error probabilities result in longer compilation and execution times and larger space requirements.Table lookup performancePBSs are very expensive, in terms of computations. Fortunately, it is sometimes possible to replace PBS by rounded PBS, truncate PBS or even approximate PBS. These TLUs have a slightly different semantic, but are very useful in cases like machine learning for more efficiency without drop of accuracy.PreviousAdvanced featuresNextRoundingLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Tagging | Concrete

Tagging | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresTaggingThis document explains the concept of tagging, which is a debugging tool to make a link between the user's Python code and the Concrete MLIR circuits. Such a link can be useful when an issue is raised by the compiler on some MLIR, to know which Python code it corresponds to.When you have big circuits, keeping track of which node corresponds to which part of your code becomes difficult. A tagging system can simplify such situations: g(z):
with fhe.tag("def"):
a = 120 - z
b = a // 4
return b
def f(x):
with fhe.tag("abc"):
x = x * 2
with fhe.tag("foo"):
y = x + 42
z = np.sqrt(y).astype(np.int64)
return g(z + 3) * 2When you compile f with inputset of range(10), you get the following graph: %1 = 2 # ClearScalar<uint2> ∈ [2, 2] @ abc
%2 = multiply(%0, %1) # EncryptedScalar<uint5> ∈ [0, 18] @ abc
%3 = 42 # ClearScalar<uint6> ∈ [42, 42] @ abc.foo
%4 = add(%2, %3) # EncryptedScalar<uint6> ∈ [42, 60] @ abc.foo
%5 = subgraph(%4) # EncryptedScalar<uint3> ∈ [6, 7] @ abc
%6 = 3 # ClearScalar<uint2> ∈ [3, 3]
%7 = add(%5, %6) # EncryptedScalar<uint4> ∈ [9, 10]
%8 = 120 # ClearScalar<uint7> ∈ [120, 120] @ def
%9 = subtract(%8, %7) # EncryptedScalar<uint7> ∈ [110, 111] @ def
%10 = 4 # ClearScalar<uint3> ∈ [4, 4] @ def
%11 = floor_divide(%9, %10) # EncryptedScalar<uint5> ∈ [27, 27] @ def
%12 = 2 # ClearScalar<uint2> ∈ [2, 2]
%13 = multiply(%11, %12) # EncryptedScalar<uint6> ∈ [54, 54]
return %13
Subgraphs:
%5 = subgraph(%4):
%0 = input # EncryptedScalar<uint2> @ abc.foo
%1 = sqrt(%0) # EncryptedScalar<float64> @ abc
%2 = astype(%1, dtype=int_) # EncryptedScalar<uint1> @ abc
return %2If you get an error, you'll see exactly where the error occurred (e.g., which layer of the neural network, if you tag layers).In the future, we plan to use tags for additional features (e.g., to measure performance of tagged regions), so it's a good idea to start utilizing them for big circuits.PreviousDirect circuitsNextCryptography basicsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Truncating | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresTruncatingThis document details the concept of truncating, and how it is used in Concrete to make some FHE computations especially faster.Table lookups have a strict constraint on the number of bits they support. This can be limiting, especially if you don't need exact precision. As well as this, using larger bit-widths leads to slower table lookups.To overcome these issues, truncated table lookups are introduced. This operation provides a way to zero the least significant bits of a large integer and then apply the table lookup on the resulting (smaller) value.Imagine you have a 5-bit value, you can use fhe.truncate_bit_pattern(value, lsbs_to_remove=2) to truncate it (here the last 2 bits are discarded). Once truncated, value will remain in 5-bits (e.g., 22 = 0b10110 would be truncated to 20 = 0b10100), and the last 2 bits of it would be zero. Concrete uses this to optimize table lookups on the truncated value, the 5-bit table lookup gets optimized to a 3-bit table lookup, which is much faster!Let's see how truncation works in practice: matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from concrete import fhe
original_bit_width = 5
lsbs_to_remove = 2
assert 0 < lsbs_to_remove < original_bit_width

if truncated != previous_truncated:
previous_truncated = truncated

axs[lsbs_to_remove].plot(input_range, results[lsbs_to_remove])
plt.show()prints:lsbs_to_remove=1 => 1.69x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=2 => 3.48x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=3 => 3.06x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=4 => 3.46x speedup
lsbs_to_remove=5 => 3.14x speedupThese speed-ups can vary from system to system.The reason why the speed-up is not increasing with lsbs_to_remove is because the truncating operation itself has a cost: each bit removal is a PBS. Therefore, if a lot of bits are removed, truncation itself could take longer than the bigger TLU which is evaluated afterwards.and displays:Auto TruncatorsTruncating is very useful but, in some cases, you don't know how many bits your input contains, so it's not reliable to specify lsbs_to_remove manually. For this reason, the AutoTruncator class is introduced.AutoTruncator allows you to set how many of the most significant bits to keep, but they need to be adjusted using an inputset to determine how many of the least significant bits to remove. This can be done manually using fhe.AutoTruncator.adjust(function, inputset), or by setting auto_adjust_truncators configuration to True during compilation.Here is how auto truncators can be used in FHE:import time

# Non-linear operations | Concrete

Non-linear operations | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageNon-linear operationsThis document introduces the usages and optimization strategies of non-linear operations in Concrete, focusing on comparisons, min/max operations, bitwise operations, and shifts. For a more in-depth explanation on advanced options, refer to the Table Lookup advanced documentation.Overview of non-linear operationsIn Concrete, there are two types of operations:Linear operations: These include additions, subtractions, and multiplications by an integer. They are computationally fast.Non-linear operations: These require Table Lookups (TLUs) to maintain the semantic integrity of the user's program. The performance of TLUs is slower and vary depending on the bit width of the inputs.Changing bit width in the MLIR or dynamically with a TLUBinary operations often require operands to have matching bit widths. This adjustment can be achieved in two ways: either directly within the MLIR or dynamically at execution time using a TLU. Each method has its own advantages and trade-offs, so Concrete provides multiple configuration options for non-linear functions.MLIR adjustment: This method doesn't require an expensive TLU. However, it may affect other parts of your program if the adjusted operand is used elsewhere, potentially causing more changes.Dynamic adjustment with TLU: This method is more localized and won’t impact other parts of your program, but it’s more expensive due to the cost of using a TLU.General guidelinesIn the following non-linear operations, we propose a certain number of configurations, using the two methods on the different operands. It’s not always clear which option will be the fastest, so we recommend trying out different configurations to see what works best for your circuit.Note that you have the option to set show_mlir=True to view how the MLIR handles TLUs and bit width changes. However, it's not essential to understand these details. So we recommend just testing the configurations and pick the one that performs best for your case.ComparisonsFor comparison, there are 7 available methods. Here's the general principle:from concrete import fhe

comparison_strategy_preference=config,

circuit = compiler.compile(inputset, configuration, show_mlir=True)The shifts_with_promotion is either True or False.Relation with fhe.multivariateAll binary operations described in this document can also be implemented with the fhe.multivariate function which is described in fhe.multivariate function documentation.

# Bit extraction | Concrete

Bit extraction | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOther operationsBit extractionThis document provides an overview of the bit extraction feature in Concrete, including usage examples, limitations, and performance considerations.OverviewBit extraction could be useful in some applications that require directly manipulating bits of integers. Bit extraction allows you to extract a specific slice of bits from an integer, where index 0 corresponds to the least significant bit (LSB). The cost of this operation increases with the index of the highest significant bit you wish to extract.Bit extraction only works in the Native encoding, which is usually selected when all table lookups in the circuit are less than or equal to 8 bits.Extracting a specific bit concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.bits(x)[0], fhe.bits(x)[3]
inputset = range(32)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_00000) == (0, 0)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_00001) == (1, 0)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_01100) == (0, 1)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_01101) == (1, 1)Extracting multiple bits with slicesYou can use slices for indexing fhe.bits(value) :
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.bits(x)[1:4]
inputset = range(32)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_01101) == 0b_110
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_01011) == 0b_101Bit extraction supports slices with negative steps:
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.bits(x)[3:0:-1]
inputset = range(32)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_01101) == 0b_011
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0b_01011) == 0b_101Bit extraction with signed integersBit extraction supports signed integers:
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.bits(x)[1:3]
inputset = range(-16, 16)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(-14) == 0b_01 # -14 == 0b_10010 (in two's complement)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(-12) == 0b_10 # -12 == 0b_10100 (in two's complement)Use case exampleHere's a practical example that uses bit extraction to determine if a number is even:from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def is_even(x):
return 1 - fhe.bits(x)[0]
inputset = [
np.random.randint(-16, 16, size=(5,))
for _ in range(100)
]
circuit = is_even.compile(inputset)
sample = np.random.randint(-16, 16, size=(5,))
for value, value_is_even in zip(sample, circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(sample)):
print(f"{value} is {'even' if value_is_even else 'odd'}")It prints:0 is even
-15 is odd
2 is even
-6 is evenLimitationsNegative indexing is not supported: Bits extraction using negative indices is not supported, such as fhe.bits(x)[-1].This is because the bit-width of x is unknown before inputset evaluation, making it impossible to determine the correct bit to extract.Reverse slicing requires explicit starting bit: When extracting bits in reverse order (using a negative step), the start bit must be specified, for example, fhe.bits(x)[::-1] is not supported.Signed integer slicing requires explicit stopping bit: For signed integers, when using slices, the stop bit must be explicitly provided, for example, fhe.bits(x)[1:] is not supported.Float bit extraction is not supported: While Concrete supports floats to some extent, bit extraction is not possible on float types.Performance considerationsA Chain of individual bit extractionsExtracting a specific bit requires clearing all the preceding lower bits. This involves extracting these previous bits as intermediate values and then subtracting them from the input.Implications:Bits are extracted sequentially, starting from the least significant bit to the more significant ones. The cost is proportional to the index of the highest extracted bit plus one.No parallelization is possible. The computation time is proportional to the cost, independent of the number of CPUs.Examples:Extracting fhe.bits(x)[4] is approximately five times costlier than extracting fhe.bits(x)[0].Extracting fhe.bits(x)[4] takes around five times more wall clock time than fhe.bits(x)[0].The cost of extracting fhe.bits(x)[0:5] is almost the same as that of fhe.bits(x)[5].Reuse of Intermediate Extracted BitsCommon sub-expression elimination is applied to intermediate extracted bits.Implications:The overall cost for a series of fhe.bits(x)[m:n] calls on the same input x is almost equivalent to the cost of the single most computationally expensive extraction in the series, i.e. fhe.bits(x)[n].The order of extraction in that series does not affect the overall cost.Example:The combined operation fhe.bit(x)[3] + fhe.bit(x)[2] + fhe.bit(x)[1] has almost the same cost as fhe.bits(x)[3].TLUs of 1b input precisionEach extracted bit incurs a cost of approximately one TLU of 1-bit input precision. Therefore, fhe.bits(x)[0] is generally faster than any other TLU operation.PreviousOther operationsNextCommon tipsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Extensions | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOther operationsExtensionsThis document introduces some extensions of Concrete, including functions for wrapping univariate and multivariate functions, performing convolution and maxpool operations, creating encrypted arrays, and more.fhe.univariate(function)Wraps any univariate function into a single table lookup: numpy as np

def value_if_condition_else_zero(value, condition):

sample = [np.array([[3, -1], [2, 4]]), 1]
assert np.array_equal(circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(*sample), function(*sample))The wrapped functions must follow these criteria:No side effects: For example, avoid modifying global state.Deterministic: For example, no random number generation.Broadcastable shapes: input.shape should be broadcastable to output.shape for all inputs.Element-wise mapping: Each output element must correspond to a single input element, for example, output[0] should only depend on input[0] of all inputs.Violating these constraints may result in undefined outcome.Multivariate functions cannot be called with rounded inputs.fhe.conv(...)Perform a convolution operation, with the same semantic as onnx.Conv:from concrete import fhe
weight = np.array([[2, 1], [3, 2]]).reshape(1, 1, 2, 2)
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.conv(x, weight, strides=(2, 2), dilations=(1, 1), group=1)
inputset = [np.random.randint(0, 4, size=(1, 1, 4, 4)) for _ in range(10)]

[3, 2, 1, 0],
[3, 2, 1, 0],
[3, 2, 1, 0],
]
).reshape(1, 1, 4, 4)
assert np.array_equal(circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(sample), f(sample))Only 2D convolutions without padding and with one group are currently supported.fhe.maxpool(...)Perform a maxpool operation, with the same semantic as onnx.MaxPool:from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.maxpool(x, kernel_shape=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2), dilations=(1, 1))

[3, 2, 1, 0],
[3, 2, 1, 0],
]
).reshape(1, 1, 4, 4)
assert np.array_equal(circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(sample), f(sample))Only 2D maxpooling without padding and up to 15-bits is currently supported.fhe.array(...)Create encrypted arrays:from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
def f(x, y):
return fhe.array([x, y])
inputset = [(3, 2), (7, 0), (0, 7), (4, 2)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
sample = (3, 4)
assert np.array_equal(circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(*sample), f(*sample))Currently, only scalars can be used to create arrays.fhe.zero()Create an encrypted scalar zero:import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
z = fhe.zero()
return x + z
inputset = range(10)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for x in range(10):
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(x) == xfhe.zeros(shape)Create an encrypted tensor of zeros:import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):

return x + z
inputset = range(10)

return x + z
inputset = range(10)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for x in range(10):

@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
z = fhe.ones((2, 3))
return x + z
inputset = range(10)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for x in range(10):
assert np.array_equal(circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(x), np.array([[x, x, x], [x, x, x]]) + 1)fhe.constant(value)Allows you to create an encrypted constant of a given value.import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted", "a":"clear"})
def f(x, a):
z = fhe.constant(a)
return x + z
inputset = range(10)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
for x in range(10):
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(x, 5) == x + 5This extension is also compatible with constant arrays.fhe.hint(value, **kwargs)Hint properties of a value. Imagine you have this circuit:import numpy as np
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x, y, z):
a = x | y
b = y & z
c = a ^ b
return c
inputset = [
(np.random.randint(0, 2**8), np.random.randint(0, 2**8), np.random.randint(0, 2**8))
for _ in range(3)
]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
print(circuit)You'd expect all of a, b, and c to be 8-bits, but because inputset is very small, this code could print:%1 = y # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [52, 219]
%2 = z # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [36, 252]
%3 = bitwise_or(%0, %1) # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [243, 255]
%4 = bitwise_and(%1, %2) # EncryptedScalar<uint7> ∈ [0, 112]
^^^^^ this can lead to bugs
%5 = bitwise_xor(%3, %4) # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [131, 255]
return %5The first solution in these cases should be to use a bigger inputset, but it can still be tricky to solve with the inputset. That's where the hint extension comes into play. Hints are a way to provide extra information to compilation process:Bit-width hints are for constraining the minimum number of bits in the encoded value. If you hint a value to be 8-bits, it means it should be at least uint8 or int8.To fix f using hints, you can do:def f(x, y, z):
# Extensions | Concrete
x = fhe.hint(x, bit_width=8)
y = fhe.hint(y, bit_width=8)
z = fhe.hint(z, bit_width=8)
# Extensions | Concrete
a = fhe.hint(x | y, bit_width=8)
b = fhe.hint(y & z, bit_width=8)
c = fhe.hint(a ^ b, bit_width=8)
return cHints are only applied to the value being hinted, and no other value. If you want the hint to be applied to multiple values, you need to hint all of them.you'll always see:%1 = y # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [...]
%2 = z # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [...]
%3 = bitwise_or(%0, %1) # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [...]
%4 = bitwise_and(%1, %2) # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [...]
%5 = bitwise_xor(%3, %4) # EncryptedScalar<uint8> ∈ [...]
return %5regardless of the bounds.Alternatively, you can use it to make sure a value can store certain integers:def is_vectors_same(x, y):
assert x.ndim != 1
assert y.ndim != 1
assert len(x) == len(y)
n = len(x)
number_of_same_elements = np.sum(x == y)
fhe.hint(number_of_same_elements, can_store=n) # hint that number of same elements can go up to n
is_same = number_of_same_elements == n
return is_samefhe.relu(value)Perform ReLU operation, with the same semantic as x if x >= 0 else 0:from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.relu(x)
inputset = [np.random.randint(-10, 10) for _ in range(10)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0) == 0
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1) == 1
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(-1) == 0
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(-3) == 0
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(5) == 5ReLU Conversion methodsThe ReLU operation can be implemented in two ways:Single TLU (Table Lookup Unit) on the original bit-width: Suitable for small bit-widths, as it requires fewer resources.Multiple TLUs on smaller bit-widths: Better for large bit-widths, avoiding the high cost of a single large TLU.Configuration optionsThe method of conversion is controlled by the relu_on_bits_threshold: int = 7 option. For example, setting relu_on_bits_threshold=5 means:Bit-widths from 1 to 4 will use a single TLU.Bit-widths of 5 and above will use multiple TLUs.Another option to fine-tune the implementation is relu_on_bits_chunk_size: int = 2. For example, setting relu_on_bits_chunk_size=4 means that when using second implementation (using chunks), the input is split to 4-bit chunks using fhe.bits, and then the ReLU is applied to those chunks, which are then combined back.Here is a script showing how execution cost is impacted when changing these values:import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
chunk_sizes = np.array(range(1, 6), dtype=int)
bit_widths = np.array(range(5, 17), dtype=int)
data = []
for bit_width in bit_widths:
title = f"{bit_width=}:"
print(title)
print("-" * len(title))
inputset = range(-2**(bit_width-1), 2**(bit_width-1))
configuration = fhe.Configuration(relu_on_bits_threshold=17)
compiler = fhe.Compiler(lambda x: fhe.relu((fhe.relu(x) - (2**(bit_width-2))) * 2), {"x": "encrypted"})
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset, configuration)
print(f" Complexity: {circuit.complexity} # tlu")
data.append((bit_width, 0, circuit.complexity))
for chunk_size in chunk_sizes:
configuration = fhe.Configuration(
relu_on_bits_threshold=1,
relu_on_bits_chunk_size=int(chunk_size),
)
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset, configuration)
print(f" Complexity: {circuit.complexity} # {chunk_size=}")
data.append((bit_width, chunk_size, circuit.complexity))
print()
data = np.array(data)
plt.title(f"ReLU using TLU vs using bits")
plt.xlabel("Input/Output precision")
plt.ylabel("Cost")
for i, chunk_size in enumerate([0] + list(chunk_sizes)):
costs = [
cost
for _, candidate_chunk_size, cost in data
if candidate_chunk_size == chunk_size
]
assert len(costs) == len(bit_widths)
label = "Single TLU" if i == 0 else f"Bits extract + multiples {chunk_size + 1} bits TLUs"
width_bar = 0.8 / (len(chunk_sizes) + 1)
if i == 0:
plt.hlines(
costs,
bit_widths - 0.45,
bit_widths + 0.45,
label=label,
linestyle="--",
)
else:
plt.bar(
np.array(bit_widths) + width_bar * (i - (len(chunk_sizes) + 1) / 2),
height=costs,
width=width_bar,
label=label,
)
plt.xticks(bit_widths)
plt.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()You might need to run the script twice to avoid crashing when plotting.The script will show the following figure:The default values of these options are set based on simple circuits. How they affect performance will depend on the circuit, so play around with them to get the most out of this extension.Conversion with the second method (using chunks) only works in Native encoding, which is usually selected when all table lookups in the circuit are below or equal to 8 bits.fhe.if_then_else(condition, x, y)Perform ternary if operation, with the same semantic as x if condition else y:from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"condition": "encrypted", "x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
def f(condition, x, y):
return fhe.if_then_else(condition, x, y)
inputset = [
(
np.random.randint(0, 2**1),
np.random.randint(0, 2**5),
np.random.randint(-2**3, 2**3),
)
for _ in range(10)
]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1, 3, 5) == 3
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0, 3, 5) == 5
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1, 3, -5) == 3
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0, 3, -5) == -5fhe.if_then_else is just an alias for np.where.fhe.identity(value)Copy the value:from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return fhe.identity(x)
inputset = [np.random.randint(-10, 10) for _ in range(10)]
circuit = f.compile(inputset)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(0) == 0
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(1) == 1
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(-1) == -1
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(-3) == -3
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(5) == 5The fhe.identity extension is useful for cloning an input with a different bit-width.Identity extension only works in Native encoding, which is usually selected when all table lookups in the circuit are below or equal to 8 bits.fhe.refresh(value)It is similar to fhe.identity but with the extra guarantee that encryption noise is refreshed.Refresh is useful when you want to control precisely where encryption noise is refreshed in your circuit. For instance if you are using modules, sometimes compilation rejects the module because it's not composable. This happens because a function of the module never refresh the encryption noise. Adding a return fhe.refresh(result) on the function result solves the issue.Refresh extension only works in Native encoding, which is usually selected when all table lookups in the circuit are below or equal to 8 bits.fhe.inputset(...)Create a random inputset with the given specifications:assert isinstance(inputset, list)
assert all(isinstance(sample, tuple) and len(sample) == 3 for sample in inputset)The result will have 100 inputs by default which can be customized using the size keyword argument:assert len(inputset) == 10PreviousCommon tipsNextCombining compiled functionsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Common tips | Concrete

Common tips | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOther operationsCommon tipsThis document introduces several common techniques for optimizing code to fit Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) constraints. The examples provided demonstrate various workarounds and performance optimizations that you can implement while working with the Concrete library.All code snippets provided here are temporary workarounds. In future versions of Concrete, some functions described here could be directly available in a more generic and efficient form. These code snippets are coming from support answers in our community forumRetrieving a value within an encrypted array with an encrypted indexThis example demonstrates how to retrieve a value from an array using an encrypted index. The method creates a "selection" array filled with 0s except for the requested index, which will be 1. It then sums the products of all array values with this selection array: numpy as np
from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"array": "encrypted", "index": "encrypted"})
def indexed_value(array, index):
all_indices = np.arange(array.size)
index_selection = index == all_indices
selection_and_zeros = array * index_selection
selection = np.sum(selection_and_zeros)
return selection
inputset = [(np.random.randint(0, 16, size=5), np.random.randint(0, 5)) for _ in range(50)]
circuit = indexed_value.compile(inputset)
array = np.random.randint(0, 16, size=5)
index = np.random.randint(0, 5)
assert circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(array, index) == array[index]Filter an array with comparison (>)This example filters an encrypted array with an encrypted condition, in this case a greater than comparison with an encrypted value. It packs all values with a selection bit that results from the comparison, allowing the unpacking of only the filtered values:from concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"numbers": "encrypted", "threshold": "encrypted"})
def filtering(numbers, threshold):
is_greater = numbers > threshold
shifted_numbers = numbers * 2 # open space for a single bit at the end
combined_numbers_and_is_greater = shifted_numbers + is_greater # put is_greater to that bit
def extract(combination):
is_greater = (combination % 2) == 1 # extract is_greater back from packing
if_true = combination // 2 # if is greater is true, we unpack the number and use it
if_false = 0 # otherwise we set the element to zero
return np.where(is_greater, if_true, if_false) # and apply the operation
return fhe.univariate(extract)(combined_numbers_and_is_greater)
inputset = [(np.random.randint(0, 16, size=5), np.random.randint(0, 16)) for _ in range(50)]
circuit = filtering.compile(inputset)
numbers = np.random.randint(0, 16, size=5)
threshold = np.random.randint(0, 16)
assert np.array_equal(circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(numbers, threshold), list(map(lambda x: x if x > threshold else 0, numbers)))
Matrix Row/Col meansThis example introduces a key concept when using Concrete: maximizing parallelization. Instead of sequentially summing all values to compute a mean, the values are split into sub-groups, and the mean of these sub-group means is computed:from concrete import fhe
def smallest_prime_divisor(n):
if n % 2 == 0:
return 2
for i in range(3, int(np.sqrt(n)) + 1):
if n % i == 0:
return i
return n
def mean_of_vector(x):
assert x.size != 0
if x.size == 1:
return x[0]
group_size = smallest_prime_divisor(x.size)
if x.size == group_size:
return np.round(np.sum(x) / x.size).astype(np.int64)
groups = []
for i in range(x.size // group_size):
start = i * group_size
end = start + group_size
groups.append(x[start:end])
mean_of_groups = []
for group in groups:

# Deploy | Concrete

Deploy | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageDeployDeployThis document explains how to deploy a circuit after the development. After developing your circuit, you may want to deploy it without sharing the circuit's details with every client or hosting computations on dedicated servers. In this scenario, you can use the Client and Server features of Concrete.Deployment processIn a typical Concrete deployment:The server hosts the compilation artifact, including client specifications and the FHE executable.The client requests circuit requirements, generates keys, sends an encrypted payload, and receives an encrypted result.
Client->>Server: Client specifications?
Server-->>Client: Client specifications
Client->>Client: Private + Evaluation Keys Generation
Client->>Server: Encrypted(data) + Evaluation Key
Server->>Server: Compiled library execution
Server-->>Client: Encrypted(result)
Client->>Client: Decrypt(result)ExampleFollow these steps to deploy your circuit:Develop the circuit: You can develop your own circuit using the techniques discussed in previous chapters. Here is an example.
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def function(x):
return x + 42
inputset = range(10)
circuit = function.compile(inputset)Save the server files: Once you have your circuit, save the necessary server files.Send the server files: Send server.zip to your computation server.Setting up a serverLoad the server files: To set up the server, load the server.zip file received from the development machine.
server = fhe.Server.load("server.zip")Prepare for client requests: The server needs to wait for the requests from clients.Serialize ClientSpecs: The requests typically starts with ClientSpecs as clients need ClientSpecs to generate keys and request computation.Send serialized ClientSpecs to clients.Setting up clientsCreate the client object: After receiving the serialized ClientSpecs from a server, create the Client object.client = fhe.Client(client_specs)Generating keys (client-side)Generate keys: Once you have the Client object, perform key generation. This method generates encryption/decryption keys and evaluation keys.Serialize the evaluation keys: The server needs access to the evaluation keys. You can serialize your evaluation keys as below.Send the evaluation keys to the server.Serialized evaluation keys are very large, even if they are compressed and can be reused several times: consider caching them on the serverEncrypting inputs (client-side)Encrypt inputs: Encrypt your inputs and request the server to perform some computation. This can be done in the following way.serialized_arg: bytes = arg.serialize()Send the serialized arguments to the server.Performing computation (server-side)Deserialize received data: On the server, deserialize the received evaluation keys and arguments received from the client.deserialized_arg = fhe.Value.deserialize(serialized_arg)Run the computation: Perform the computation and serialize the result.serialized_result: bytes = result.serialize()Send the serialized result to the client:Clear arguments can directly be passed to server.run (For example, server.run(x, 10, z, evaluation_keys=...)).Decrypting the result (on the client)Deserialize the result: Once you receive the serialized result from the server, deserialize it.Decrypt the deserialized result:assert decrypted_result == 49Deployment of modulesDeploying a module follows the same logic as the deployment of circuits.For example, consider a module compiled in the following way:
@fhe.module()
class MyModule:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def inc(x):
return x + 1
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def dec(x):
return x - 1
inputset = list(range(20))
my_module = MyModule.compile({"inc": inputset, "dec": inputset})
)You can extract the server from the module and save it in a file:The only noticeable difference between the deployment of modules and the deployment of circuits is that the methods Client::encrypt, Client::decrypt and Server::run must contain an extra function_name argument specifying the name of the targeted function.For example, to encrypt an argument for the inc function of the module:serialized_arg = arg.serialize()To execute the inc function:serialized_result = result.serialize()To decrypt a result from the execution of dec:PreviousManage keysNextTFHE-rs InteroperabilityLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Manage keys | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageManage keysThis document explains how to manage keys when using Concrete, introducing the key management API for generating, reusing, and securely handling keys.Concrete generates keys lazily when needed. While this is convenient for development, it's not ideal for the production environment. The explicit key management API is available for you to easily generate and reuse keys as needed.DefinitionLet's start by defining a circuit with the following example: concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
return x ** 2
inputset = range(10)
circuit = f.compile(inputset)Circuits have a keys property of type fhe.Keys, which includes several utilities for key management.GenerationTo explicitly generate keys for a circuit, use:.keys.generate()Generated keys are stored in memory and remain unencrypted.You can also set a custom seed for reproducibility:Do not specify the seed manually in a production environment! This is not secure and should only be done for debugging purposes.SerializationTo serialize keys, for tasks such as sending them across a network, use:Keys are not serialized in encrypted form. Please make sure you keep them in a safe environment, or encrypt them manually after serialization.DeserializationTo deserialize the keys back after receiving serialized keys, use:AssignmentOnce you have a valid fhe.Keys object, you can directly assign it to the circuit:If assigned keys are generated for a different circuit, an exception will be raised.SavingYou can also use the filesystem to store the keys directly, without managing serialization and file management manually:Keys are not saved in encrypted form. Please make sure you store them in a safe environment, or encrypt them manually after saving.LoadingAfter saving keys to disk, you can load them back using:Automatic ManagementIf you want to generate keys in the first run and reuse the keys in consecutive runs, use:PreviousConfigureNextDeployLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# TFHE-rs Interoperability | Concrete

*Source: concrete/guides/tfhers.html*

TFHE-rs Interoperability | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageTFHE-rs InteroperabilityThis feature is currently in beta version. Please note that the API may change in future Concrete releases.This guide explains how to combine Concrete and TFHE-rs computations together. This allows you to convert ciphertexts from Concrete to TFHE-rs, and vice versa, and to run a computation with both libraries without requiring a decryption.OverviewThere are differences between Concrete and TFHE-rs, so ensuring interoperability between them involves more than just data serialization. To achieve interoperability, we need to consider two main aspects.Encoding differencesBoth TFHE-rs and Concrete libraries use Learning with errors(LWE) ciphertexts, but integers are encoded differently:In Concrete, integers are simply encoded in a single ciphertextIn TFHE-rs, integers are encoded into multiple ciphertext using radix decompositionConverting between Concrete and TFHE-rs encrypted integers then require doing an encrypted conversion between the two different encodings.When working with a TFHE-rs integer type in Concrete, you can use the .encode(...) and .decode(...) functions to see this in practice: concrete.fhe import tfhers
# TFHE-rs Interoperability | Concrete
# TFHE-rs Interoperability | Concrete
tfhers_type = tfhers.get_type_from_params(
"tfhers_params.json",
is_signed=False,
precision=8,
)
# TFHE-rs Interoperability | Concrete
# TFHE-rs Interoperability | Concrete
assert (tfhers_type.encode(123) == [3, 2, 3, 1]).all()
assert tfhers_type.decode([3, 2, 3, 1]) == 123Parameter matchThe Concrete Optimizer may find parameters which are not in TFHE-rs's pre-computed list. To ensure interoperability, you need to either fix or constrain the search space in parts of the circuit where interoperability is required. This ensures that compatible parameters are used consistently.ScenariosThere are 2 different approaches to using Concrete and THFE-rs depending on the situation.Scenario 1: Shared secret key: In this scenario, a single party aims to combine both Concrete and TFHE-rs in a computation. In this case, a shared secret key will be used, while different keysets will be held for Concrete and TFHE-rs.Scenario 2: Pregenerated TFHE-rs keys: This scenario involves two parties, each with a pre-established set of TFHE-rs keysets. The objective is to compute on encrypted TFHE-rs data using Concrete. In this case, there is no shared secret key. The party using Concrete will rely solely on TFHE-rs public keys and must optimize the parameters accordingly, while the party using TFHE-rs handles encryption, decryption, and computation.Serialization of ciphertexts and keysConcrete already has its serilization functions (such as tfhers_bridge.export_value, tfhers_bridge.import_value, tfhers_bridge.keygen_with_initial_keys, tfhers_bridge.serialize_input_secret_key, and so on). However, when implementing a TFHE-rs computation in Rust, we must use a compatible serialization.

# Shared key | Concrete
tfhers_int = partial(tfhers.TFHERSInteger, tfhers_type)Defining the circuit and compilingWe will now define a simple modular addition function. This function takes TFHE-rs inputs, converts them to Concrete format (to_native), runs a computation, and then converts them back to TFHE-rs. The circuit below is a common example that takes and produces TFHE-rs ciphertexts. However, there are other scenarios where you might not convert back to TFHE-rs, or you might convert to a different type than the input. Another possibility is to take one native ciphertext and one TFHE-rs ciphertext. ####### TFHE-rs to Concrete #########
# Shared key | Concrete
# Shared key | Concrete
# Shared key | Concrete
concrete_x = tfhers.to_native(tfhers_x)
concrete_y = tfhers.to_native(tfhers_y)

####### Concrete to TFHE-rs #########
tfhers_res = tfhers.from_native(
concrete_res, tfhers_type
) # we have to specify the type we want to convert to
####### Concrete to TFHE-rs #########
return tfhers_resWe can compile the circuit as usual.inputset = [(tfhers_int(120), tfhers_int(120))]
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset)You could optionally try the full execution in Concreteencrypted_x, encrypted_y = circuit.encrypt(tfhers_type.encode(7), tfhers_type.encode(9))
# Shared key | Concrete
encrypted_result = circuit.run(encrypted_x, encrypted_y)
# Shared key | Concrete
result = circuit.decrypt(encrypted_result)
# Shared key | Concrete
decoded = tfhers_type.decode(result)Connecting Concrete and TFHE-rsWe are going to create a TFHE-rs bridge that facilitates the seamless transfer of ciphertexts and keys between Concrete and TFHE-rs.Key generationIn order to establish a shared secret key between Concrete and TFHE-rs, there are two possible methods for key generation. The first method (use case 1.1) involves generating the Concrete keyset first and then using the shared secret key in TFHE-rs to partially generate the TFHE-rs keyset. The second method (use case 1.2) involves doing the opposite. You should only run one of the two following methods.Remember that one key generation need to be a partial keygen, to be sure that there is a unique and common secret key.Parameters used in TFHE-rs must be the same as the ones used in Concrete.KeyGen starts in Concrete (use case 1.1)First, we generate the Concrete keyset and then serialize the shared secret key that will be used to encrypt the inputs. In our case, this shared secret key is the same for all inputs and outputs.circuit.keygen()
# Shared key | Concrete
secret_key: bytes = tfhers_bridge.serialize_input_secret_key(input_idx=0)
# Shared key | Concrete
with open("secret_key_from_concrete", "wb") as f:
f.write(secret_key)Next, we generate client and server keys in TFHE-rs using the shared secret key from Concrete. We will cover serialization in a later section, so there's no need to worry about how we loaded the secret key. For now, we will consider having 4 functions (save_lwe_sk, save_fheuint8, load_lwe_sk, load_fheuint8) which respectively save/load an LWE secret key and an FheUint8 to/from a given path.use tfhe::ClientKey;
/// ...
let lwe_sk: LweSecretKey<Vec<u64>> = load_lwe_sk("secret_key_from_concrete");
let shortint_key =
tfhe::shortint::ClientKey::try_from_lwe_encryption_key(
lwe_sk,
// Concrete uses this parameters to define the TFHE-rs ciphertext type
tfhe::shortint::prelude::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_3_KS_PBS
).unwrap();
let client_key = ClientKey::from_raw_parts(shortint_key.into(), None, None, tfhe::Tag::default());
let server_key = client_key.generate_server_key();KeyGen starts in TFHE-rs (use case 1.2)First, we generate the TFHE-rs keyset and then serialize the shared secret key that will be used to encrypt the inputsuse tfhe::generate_keys;
/// ...
// Concrete uses this parameters to define the TFHE-rs ciphertext type
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(
tfhe::shortint::prelude::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_3_KS_PBS,
)
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let (integer_ck, _, _, _) = client_key.clone().into_raw_parts();
let shortint_ck = integer_ck.into_raw_parts();
let (glwe_secret_key, _, _) = shortint_ck.into_raw_parts();
let lwe_secret_key = glwe_secret_key.into_lwe_secret_key();
save_lwe_sk(lwe_secret_key, "secret_key_from_tfhers");Next, we generate a Concrete keyset using the shared secret key from TFHE-rs.with open("secret_key_from_tfhers", "rb") as f:
sk_buff = f.read()
# Shared key | Concrete
input_idx_to_key = {0: sk_buff, 1: sk_buff}
# Shared key | Concrete
tfhers_bridge.keygen_with_initial_keys(input_idx_to_key_buffer=input_idx_to_key)Using ciphertextsAt this point, we have everything necessary to encrypt, compute, and decrypt on both Concrete and TFHE-rs. Whether you began key generation in Concrete or in TFHE-rs, the keysets on both sides are compatible.Now, we'll walk through an encryption and computation process in TFHE-rs, transition to Concrete to run the circuit, and then return to TFHE-rs for decryption.First, we do encryption and a simple addition in TFHE-rs. For more information on how to save ciphertexts, refer to Serialization.let y = FheUint8::encrypt(73, &client_key);
// we will add two encrypted integers in TFHE-rs to showcase
// that we are doing some part of the computation in TFHE-rs
// and the rest in Concrete
let z = FheUint8::encrypt(9, &client_key);
y += z;
save_fheuint8(x, "tfhers_x");
save_fheuint8(y, "tfhers_y");Next, we can load these ciphertexts in Concrete and then run our compiled circuit as usual. buff_x = f.read()
with open("tfhers_y", "rb") as f:
buff_y = f.read()
tfhers_uint8_x = tfhers_bridge.import_value(buff_x, input_idx=0)
tfhers_uint8_y = tfhers_bridge.import_value(buff_y, input_idx=1)
encrypted_result = circuit.run(tfhers_uint8_x, tfhers_uint8_y)Finally, we can decrypt and decode in Concretedecoded = tfhers_type.decode(result)
assert decoded == (162 + 73 + 9) % 213... or export it to TFHE-rs for computation/decryption# write it to file
with open("tfhers_out", "wb") as f:
f.write(buff_out)// you can do computation before decryption as well
let result: u8 = fheuint.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(result == (162 + 73 + 9) % 213)Full working example can be found here.PreviousTFHE-rs InteroperabilityNextSerializationLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Dataflow parallelism | Concrete

*Source: concrete/guides/self/self/dataflow.html*

Dataflow parallelism | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOptimizationImprove parallelismDataflow parallelismThis guide explains dataflow parallelism and how it can improve the execution time of Concrete circuits.Dataflow parallelism is particularly useful when the circuit performs computations that are neither completely independent (such as loop/doall parallelism) nor fully dependent (e.g. sequential, non-parallelizable code). In such cases dataflow tasks can execute as soon as their inputs are available and thus minimizing over-synchronization.Without dataflow parallelism, circuit is executed operation by operation, like an imperative language. If the operations themselves are not tensorized, loop parallelism would not be utilized and the entire execution would happen in a single thread. Dataflow parallelism changes this by analyzing the operations and their dependencies within the circuit to determine what can be done in parallel and what cannot. Then it distributes the tasks that can be done in parallel to different threads.For example: time
import numpy as np
from concrete import fhe
def f(x, y, z):
# Dataflow parallelism | Concrete

}
}To summarize, dataflow analyzes the circuit to determine which parts of the circuit can be run at the same time, and tries to run as many operations as possible in parallel.When the circuit is tensorized, dataflow might slow execution down since the tensor operations already use multiple threads and adding dataflow on top creates congestion in the CPU between the HPX (dataflow parallelism runtime) and OpenMP (loop parallelism runtime). So try both before deciding on whether to use dataflow or not.PreviousImprove parallelismNextTensorizing operationsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Reducing TLU | Concrete

Reducing TLU | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOptimizationOptimize table lookupsReducing TLUThis guide teaches how to improve the execution time of Concrete circuits by reducing the amount of table lookups.Reducing the amount of table lookups is probably the most complicated guide in this section as it's not automated. The idea is to use mathematical properties of operations to reduce the amount of table lookups needed to achieve the result.One great example is in adding big integers in bitmap representation. Here is the basic implementation: add_bitmaps(x, y):
result = fhe.zeros((N,))
carry = 0
addition = x + y
for i in range(N):
addition_and_carry = addition[i] + carry
carry = addition_and_carry >> 1
result[i] = addition_and_carry % 2
return resultThere are two table lookups within the loop body, one for >> and one for %.This implementation is not optimal though, since the same output can be achieved with just a single table lookup: add_bitmaps(x, y):
result = fhe.zeros((N,))
carry = 0
addition = x + y
for i in range(N):
addition_and_carry = addition[i] + carry
carry = addition_and_carry >> 1
result[i] = addition_and_carry - (carry * 2)
return resultIt was possible to do this because the original operations had a mathematical equivalence with the optimized operations and optimized operations achieved the same output with less table lookups!Here is the full code example and some numbers for this optimization:from concrete import fhe
N = 32
def add_bitmaps_naive(x, y):
result = fhe.zeros((N,))
carry = 0
addition = x + y
for i in range(N):
addition_and_carry = addition[i] + carry
carry = addition_and_carry >= 2
result[i] = addition_and_carry % 2
return result
def add_bitmaps_optimized(x, y):
result = fhe.zeros((N,))
carry = 0
addition = x + y
for i in range(N):
addition_and_carry = addition[i] + carry
carry = addition_and_carry >> 1
result[i] = addition_and_carry - (carry * 2)
return result
inputset = fhe.inputset(fhe.tensor[fhe.uint1, N], fhe.tensor[fhe.uint1, N])
for (name, implementation) in [("naive", add_bitmaps_naive), ("optimized", add_bitmaps_optimized)]:
compiler = fhe.Compiler(implementation, {"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset)
print(

)prints:optimized implementation -> 32 table lookups -> 1_224_206_208 complexitywhich is almost half the amount of table lookups and ~2x less complexity for the same operation!PreviousOptimize table lookupsNextImplementation strategiesLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Implementation strategies | Concrete

Implementation strategies | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOptimizationOptimize table lookupsImplementation strategiesThis guide teaches how to improve the execution time of Concrete circuits by using different conversion strategies for complex operations.Concrete provides multiple implementation strategies for these complex operations:comparisons (<,<=,==,!=,>=,>)bitwise operations (<<,&,|,^,>>)minimum and maximum operationsmultivariate extensionThe default strategy is the one that doesn't increase the input bit width, even if it's less optimal than the others. If you don't care about the input bit widths (e.g., if the inputs are only used in this operation), you should definitely change the default strategy.Choosing the correct strategy can lead to big speedups. So if you are not sure which one to use, you can compile with different strategies and compare the complexity.For example, the following code: numpy as np
from concrete import fhe
def f(x, y):
return x & y
inputset = fhe.inputset(fhe.uint3, fhe.uint4)
strategies = [
fhe.BitwiseStrategy.ONE_TLU_PROMOTED,

Debugging and artifact | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageDebugging and artifactThis document provides guidance on debugging the compilation process.Compiler debug and verbose modesTwo configuration options are available to help you understand the compilation process:compiler_verbose_mode: Prints the compiler passes and shows the transformations applied. It can help identify the crash location if a crash occurs.compiler_debug_mode: A more detailed version of the verbose mode, providing additional information, particularly useful for diagnosing crashes.These flags might not work as expected in Jupyter notebooks as they output to stderr directly from C++.Debug artifactsConcrete includes an artifact system that simplifies the debugging process by automatically or manually exporting detailed information during compilation failures.Automatic exportWhen a compilation fails, artifacts are automatically exported to the .artifacts directory in the working directory. Here's an example of what gets exported when a function fails to compile: f(x):

# GPU acceleration | Concrete

GPU acceleration | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationThis document explains how to use GPU accelerations with Concrete.Concrete supports acceleration using one or more GPUs.This version is not available on pypi.org, which only hosts wheels with CPU support.To use GPU acceleration, install the GPU/CUDA wheel from our Zama public PyPI repository using the following command:pip install concrete-python --extra-index-url https://pypi.zama.ai/gpu.After installing the GPU/CUDA wheel, you must configure the FHE program compilation to enable GPU offloading using the use_gpu option.Our GPU wheels are built with CUDA 11.8 and should be compatible with higher versions of CUDA.GPU execution configurationBy default the compiler and runtime will use all available system resources, including all CPU cores and GPUs. You can adjust this by using the following environment variables:SDFG_NUM_THREADSType: IntegerDefault value: The number of hardware threads on the system (including hyperthreading) minus the number of GPUs in use.Description: This variable determines the number of CPU threads that execute in paralelle with the GPU for offloadable workloads. GPU scheduler threads (including CUDA threads and those used within Concrete) are necessary but can block or interfere with worker thread execution. Therefore, it is recommended to undersubscribe the CPU hardware threads by the number of GPU devices used.SDFG_NUM_GPUSType: IntegerDefault value: The number of GPUs available.Description: This value determines the number of GPUs to use for offloading. This can be set to any value between 1 and the total number of GPUs on the system.SDFG_MAX_BATCH_SIZE**Type: IntegerDefault value: LLONG_MAX (no batch size limit)Description: This value limits the maximum batch size for offloading in cases where the GPU memory is insufficient.SDFG_DEVICE_TO_CORE_RATIOType: IntegerDefault value: The ratio between the compute capability of the GPU (at index 0) and a CPU core.Description: This ratio is used to balance the load between the CPU and GPU. If the GPU is underutilized, set this value higher to increase the amount of work offloaded to the GPU.OMP_NUM_THREADSType: IntegerDefault value: The number of hardware threads on the system, including hyperthreading.Description: This value specifies the portions of program execution that are not yet supported for GPU offload, which will be parallelized using OpenMP on the CPU.PreviousPerformanceNextRust integrationLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Rust integration | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageRust integrationThis document explains how to use Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) modules developed with concrete-python directly in Rust programs using the Concrete toolchain.This workflow enables rapid prototyping in Python and seamless deployment in Rust, combining the flexibility of Python with the safety and performance of Rust.OverviewWrite and compile FHE modules in Python using concrete-python.Import the compiled module artifact into Rust using the concrete-macro crate.Use the generated Rust APIs for encryption, evaluation, and decryption.PrerequisitesPython 3.8+Rust 1.70+concrete-python (>=2.10)concrete and concrete-macro Rust crates (>=2.10.1-rc1)Regular exampleStep 1: Define and Compile a Module in PythonWrite your FHE logic in Python and compile it to an artifact compatible with the Rust toolchain. Here is an example of a small and simple module:
@fhe.module()
class MyModule:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def inc(x):
return (x + 1) % 256
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def dec(x):
return (x - 1) % 256
inputset = fhe.inputset(fhe.uint8)
module = MyModule.compile({"inc": inputset, "dec": inputset})
module.server.save(path="MyModule.zip", via_mlir=True)This produces a MyModule.zip artifact containing the compiled FHE module.Step 2: Set Up the Rust ProjectInitialize a new Rust project and add the required dependencies.cargo add concrete@=2.10.1-rc1 concrete-macro@=2.10.1-rc1Place the MyModule.zip artifact in your project directory.Step 3: Import the Python-Compiled Module in RustUse the concrete_macro::from_concrete_python_export_zip! macro to import the module at build time. use concrete_macro::from_concrete_python_export_zip;
from_concrete_python_export_zip!("MyModule.zip");
}This macro unpacks the artifact, triggers recompilation, reads metadata, and generates Rust APIs for the module's functions.Step 4: Use the Module in RustYou can now use the FHE functions in Rust. The following example demonstrates a full FHE workflow:
fn main() {
// Prepare input and expected output tensors
let input = Tensor::new(vec![5], vec![]);
let expected_output = Tensor::new(vec![6], vec![]);
// Key generation
let mut secret_csprng = concrete::common::SecretCsprng::new(0u128);
let mut encryption_csprng = concrete::common::EncryptionCsprng::new(0u128);
let keyset = my_module::new_keyset(secret_csprng.pin_mut(), encryption_csprng.pin_mut());
let client_keyset = keyset.get_client();
// Create client stub for the 'inc' function
let mut inc_client = my_module::client::inc::ClientFunction::new(&client_keyset, encryption_csprng);
// Encrypt input and obtain evaluation keys
let encrypted_input = inc_client.prepare_inputs(input);
let evaluation_keys = keyset.get_server();
// Create server stub for the 'inc' function
let mut inc_server = my_module::server::inc::ServerFunction::new();
// Evaluate the function on encrypted data
let encrypted_output = inc_server.invoke(&evaluation_keys, encrypted_input);
// Decrypt the output
let decrypted_output = inc_client.process_outputs(encrypted_output);
// Check correctness
assert_eq!(decrypted_output.values(), expected_output.values());
}TFHE-rs Ciphertext InteroperabilityStarting from Concrete v2.11, you can define and use modules that operate directly on TFHE-rs ciphertexts, enabling seamless interoperability between Concrete and TFHE-rs in Rust.Step 1: Define and Compile a Module with TFHE-rs Types in PythonYou can define a module in Python that uses TFHE-rs integer types as arguments and outputs. For example:from concrete.fhe import tfhers
TFHERS_UINT_8_3_2_4096 = tfhers.TFHERSIntegerType(
False,
bit_width=8,
carry_width=3,
msg_width=2,
params=tfhers.CryptoParams(
lwe_dimension=909,
glwe_dimension=1,
polynomial_size=4096,
pbs_base_log=15,
pbs_level=2,
lwe_noise_distribution=0,
glwe_noise_distribution=2.168404344971009e-19,
encryption_key_choice=tfhers.EncryptionKeyChoice.BIG,
),
)
@fhe.module()
class MyModule:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
def my_func(x, y):
x = tfhers.to_native(x)
y = tfhers.to_native(y)
return tfhers.from_native(x + y, TFHERS_UINT_8_3_2_4096)
def t(v):
return tfhers.TFHERSInteger(TFHERS_UINT_8_3_2_4096, v)
inputset = [(t(0), t(0)), (t(2**6), t(2**6))]
my_module = MyModule.compile({"my_func": inputset})
my_module.server.save("test_tfhers.zip", via_mlir=True)This produces a test_tfhers.zip artifact compatible with Rust and TFHE-rs.Step 2: Use the Module with TFHE-rs Ciphertexts in RustYou can import and use the module in Rust, passing and receiving native TFHE-rs ciphertexts: use concrete_macro::from_concrete_python_export_zip;
from_concrete_python_export_zip!("src/test_tfhers.zip");
}
use tfhe::prelude::{FheDecrypt, FheEncrypt};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v0_10::classic::gaussian::p_fail_2_minus_64::ks_pbs::V0_10_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, FheUint8};
fn main() {
// Key generation for TFHE-rs
let config = tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(V0_10_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
// Build Concrete keyset with TFHE-rs client key
let mut secret_csprng = concrete::common::SecretCsprng::new(0u128);
let mut encryption_csprng = concrete::common::EncryptionCsprng::new(0u128);
let keyset = precompile::KeysetBuilder::new()
.with_key_for_my_func_0_arg(&client_key)
.generate(secret_csprng.pin_mut(), encryption_csprng.pin_mut());
let server_keyset = keyset.get_server();
// Encrypt inputs using TFHE-rs
let arg_0 = FheUint8::encrypt(6u8, &client_key);
let arg_1 = FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &client_key);
// Evaluate the Concrete circuit on TFHE-rs ciphertexts
let mut server = precompile::server::my_func::ServerFunction::new();
let output = server.invoke(&server_keyset, arg_0, arg_1);
// Decrypt the result using TFHE-rs
let decrypted: u8 = output.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(decrypted, 10);
}This workflow allows you to combine the high-level graph optimizations of Concrete with the operator-level flexibility of TFHE-rs, all within Rust.NotesThe module must be compiled with via_mlir=True to be loaded in the Rust program.The Rust API is currently in beta and may evolve in future releases.The Python and Rust environments must use compatible versions of the Concrete toolchain.When using TFHE-rs ciphertext interoperability, ensure that the TFHE-rs client key used for encryption matches the one registered in the Concrete keyset for the corresponding argument.PreviousGPU accelerationNextOtherLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Formatting and drawing | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOtherFormatting and drawingThis document explains how to format and draw a compiled circuit in Python.FormattingTo convert your compiled circuit into its textual representation, use the str function:(circuit)If you just want to see the output on your terminal, you can directly print it as well:(circuit)Formatting is designed for debugging purpose only. It's not possible to create the circuit back from its textual representation. See How to Deploy if that's your goal.DrawingDrawing functionality requires the installation of the package with the full feature set. See the Installation section for instructions.To draw your compiled circuit, use the draw method:= circuit.draw()This method draws the circuit, saves it as a temporary PNG file and returns the file path.You can display the drawing in a Jupyter notebook: PIL import Image
drawing = Image.open(circuit.draw())
drawing.show()
drawing.close()Alternatively, you can use the show option of the draw method to display the drawing with matplotlib:Using this option will clear any existing matplotlib plots.Lastly, to save the drawing to a specific path, use the save_to option:drawing = circuit.draw(save_to=destination)

Common errors | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCommon errorsThis document explains the most common errors and provides solutions to fix them.1. Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement concrete-python (from versions: none)Error message: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement concrete-python (from versions: none)Cause: The installation does not work fine for you.Possible solutions:Be sure that you use a supported Python version (currently from 3.9 to 3.12, included).Check that you have done pip install -U pip wheel setuptools before.Consider adding a --extra-index-url https://pypi.zama.ai/cpu or --extra-index-url https://pypi.zama.ai/gpu, depending on whether you want the CPU or the GPU wheel.Concrete requires glibc>=2.28, be sure to have a sufficiently recent version.2. Only integers are supportedError message: RuntimeError: Function you are trying to compile cannot be compiled with extra information only integers are supportedCause: Parts of your program contain graphs that are not from integer to integerPossible solutions:You can use floats as intermediate values (see the documentation). However, both inputs and outputs must be integers. Consider converting values to integers, such as .astype(np.uint64)3. No parameters foundError message: NoParametersFoundCause: The optimizer can't find cryptographic parameters for the circuit that are both secure and correct.Possible solutions:Try to simplify your circuit.Use smaller weights.Add intermediate PBS to reduce the noise, with identity function fhe.refresh(lambda x: x).4. Too long inputs for table looupError message: RuntimeError: Function you are trying to compile cannot be compiled, with extra information as this [...]-bit value is used as an input to a table lookup with but only up to 16-bit table lookups are supportedCause: The program uses a Table Lookup that contains oversized inputs exceeding the current 16-bit limit.Possible solutions:Try to simplify your circuit.Use smaller weights.Look to the graph to understand where this oversized input comes from and ensure that the input size for Table Lookup operations does not exceed 16 bits.Use show_bit_width_constraints=True to understand bit widths are assigned the way they are.5. Impossible to fuse multiple-nodesError message: RuntimeError: A subgraph within the function you are trying to compile cannot be fused because it has multiple input nodesCause: A subgraph in your program uses two or more input nodes. It is impossible to fuse such a graph, meaning replace it by a table lookup. Concrete will indicate the input nodes with this is one of the input nodes printed in the circuit.Possible solutions:Try to simplify your circuit.Have a look to fhe.multivariate.6. Function is not supportedError message: RuntimeError: Function '[...]' is not supportedCause: The function used is not currently supported by Concrete.Possible solutions:Try to change your program.Check the corresponding documentation to see if there are ways to implement the function differently.Post your issue in our community channels.7. Branching is not allowedError message: RuntimeError: Branching within circuits is not possibleCause: Branching operations, such as if statements or non-constant loops, are not supported in Concrete's FHE programs.Possible solutions:Change your program.Consider using tricks to replace ternary-if, as c ? t : f = f + c * (t-f).8. Unfeasible noise constraintError message: Unfeasible noise constraint encounteredCause: The optimizer can't find cryptographic parameters for the circuit that are both secure and correct.Possible solutions:Try to simplify your circuit.Use smaller weights.Add intermediate PBS to reduce the noise, with identity function fhe.refresh(x).9.

# Compression | Concrete

Compression | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCompressionThis document explains the compression feature in Concrete and its performance impact.Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) needs both ciphertexts (encrypted data) and evaluation keys to carry out the homomorphic evaluation of a function. Both elements are large, which may critically affect the application's performance depending on the use case, application deployment, and the method for transmitting and storing ciphertexts and evaluation keys.Enabling compressionDuring compilation, you can enable compression options to enforce the use of compression features. The two available compression options are:compress_evaluation_keys: bool = False,This specifies that serialization takes the compressed form of evaluation keys.compress_input_ciphertexts: bool = False,This specifies that serialization takes the compressed form of input ciphertexts.You can see the impact of compression by comparing the size of the serialized form of input ciphertexts and evaluation keys with a sample code: concrete import fhe
def test_compression(compression):
@fhe.compiler({"counter": "encrypted"})
def f(counter):
return counter // 2
circuit = f.compile(fhe.inputset(fhe.tensor[fhe.uint2, 3]),
compress_evaluation_keys=compression,
compress_input_ciphertexts=compression)
print(f"Sizes with compression = {compression}")
print(f" - of the input ciphertext {len(circuit.encrypt(list([0 for i in range(3)])).serialize())}")
print(f" - of the evaluation keys {len(circuit.keys.serialize())}")
test_compression(False)
test_compression(True)Compression algorithmsThe compression factor largely depends on the cryptographic parameters identified and the compression algorithms selected during the compilation.Currently, Concrete uses the seeded compression algorithms. These algorithms rely on the fact that CSPRNGs are deterministic. Consequently, the chain of random values can be replaced by the seed and later recalculated using the same seed.Typically, the size of a ciphertext is (lwe dimension + 1) * 8 bytes, while the size of a seeded ciphertext is constant, equal to 3 * 8 bytes. Thus, the compression factor ranges from a hundred to thousands. Understanding the compression factor of evaluation keys is complex. The compression factor of evaluation keys typically ranges between 0 and 10.Please note that while compression may save bandwidth and disk space, it incurs the cost of decompression. Currently, decompression occur more or less lazily during FHE evaluation without any control.PreviousMulti parametersNextReusing argumentsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Parameter compatibility with restrictions | Concrete

*Source: concrete/compilation/parameter_compatibility_with_restrictions.html*

Parameter compatibility with restrictions | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageParameter compatibility with restrictionsThis document explains how to use restrictions to limit the possible crypto-parameters used for the keys.When compiling a module, the optimizer analyzes the circuits and the expected probability of error, to identify the fastest crypto-parameters that meet the specific constraints. The chosen crypto-parameters determine the size of the keys and the ciphertexts. This means that if an existing module is used in production with a specific set of crypto-parameters, there is no guarantee that a compilation of a second, different module will yield compatible crypto-parameters.With restrictions, Concrete provides a way to ensure that a compilation generates compatible crypto-parameters. Restrictions will limit the search-space walked by the optimizer to ensure that only compatible parameters can be returned. As of now, we support two major restrictions:Keyset restriction : Restricts the crypto-parameters to an existing keyset.Ranges restriction : Restricts the crypto-parameters ranges allowed in the optimizer.Keyset restrictionYou can generate keyset restriction directly form an existing keyset:.module()

# Reusing arguments | Concrete

Reusing arguments | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageReusing argumentsThis document explains how to reuse encrypted arguments in applications where the same arguments are used repeatedly.Encrypting data can be resource-intensive, especially when the same argument or set of arguments is used multiple times. In such cases, it’s inefficient to encrypt and transfer the arguments repeatedly. Instead, you can encrypt the arguments separately and reuse them as needed. By encrypting the arguments once and reusing them, you can optimize performance by reducing encryption time, memory usage, and network bandwidth.Here is an example: concrete import fhe
@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
def add(x, y):
return x + y
inputset = [(2, 3), (0, 0), (1, 6), (7, 7), (7, 1), (3, 2), (6, 1), (1, 7), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
circuit = add.compile(inputset)
sample_y = 4
_, encrypted_y = circuit.encrypt(None, sample_y)
for sample_x in range(3, 6):
encrypted_x, _ = circuit.encrypt(sample_x, None)
encrypted_result = circuit.run(encrypted_x, encrypted_y)
result = circuit.decrypt(encrypted_result)
assert result == sample_x + sample_yNote when you use encrypt method:If you have multiple arguments, the encrypt method would return a tuple.If you specify None as one of the arguments, None is placed at the same location in the resulting tuple.For example, circuit.encrypt(a, None, b, c, None) returns (encrypted_a, None, encrypted_b, encrypted_c, None).Each value returned by encrypt can be stored and reused anytime.The order of arguments must be consistent when encrypting and using them. Encrypting an x and using it as a y could result in undefined behavior.PreviousCompressionNextParameter compatibility with restrictionsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

By default, the Concrete optimizer selects multiple sets of these parameters, which may not be optimal for every use case. In such cases, you can choose to use mono parameters instead.When multi parameters are enabled, the optimizer selects a different set of parameters for each bit-width in the circuit. This approach has several implications:Faster execution in generalSlower key generationLarger keysLarger memory usage during executionWhen enabled, you can control the level of circuit partitioning by setting the multi_parameter_strategy as described in configuration.To disable multi parameters, use parameter_selection_strategy=fhe.ParameterSelectionStrategy.MONO configuration option.PreviousMulti precisionNextCompressionLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Multi precision | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageKey-related options for faster executionMulti precisionThis document explains the multi-precision option for bit-width assignment for integers.The multi-precision option enables the frontend to use the smallest bit-width possible for each operation in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), improving computation efficiency.Bit-width and encoding differencesEach integer in the circuit has a certain bit-width, which is determined by the input-set. These bit-widths are visible when graphs are printed, for example:%1 = y # EncryptedScalar<uint4> ∈ [0, 15]
%2 = add(%0, %1) # EncryptedScalar<uint5> ∈ [2, 22]
return %2 ^ these are ^^^^^^^
the assigned based on
bit-widths these boundsHowever, adding integers with different bit-widths (for example, 3-bit and 4-bit numbers) directly isn't possible due to differences in encoding, as shown below:N: noise
3-bit number
------------
D2 D1 D0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 N N N N
4-bit number
------------
D3 D2 D1 D0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 N N N NWhen you add a 3-bit number and a 4-bit number, the result is a 5-bit number with a different encoding:------------
D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 N N N NBit-width assignment with graph processingTo address these encoding differences, a graph processing step called bit-width assignment is performed. This step updates the graph's bit-widths to ensure compatibility with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).After this step, the graph might look like this:%1 = y # EncryptedScalar<uint5>
%2 = add(%0, %1) # EncryptedScalar<uint5>
return %2Encoding flexibility with Table LookupMost operations cannot change the encoding, requiring the input and output bit-widths to remain the same. However, the table lookup operation can change the encoding. For example, consider the following graph:%1 = y # EncryptedScalar<uint5> ∈ [0, 31]
%2 = 2 # ClearScalar<uint2> ∈ [2, 2]
%3 = power(%0, %2) # EncryptedScalar<uint4> ∈ [0, 9]
%4 = add(%3, %1) # EncryptedScalar<uint6> ∈ [1, 39]
return %4This graph represents the computation (x**2) + y where x is 2-bits and y is 5-bits. Without the ability to change encodings, all bit-widths would need to be adjusted to 6-bits. However, since the encoding can change, bit-widths are assigned more efficiently:%1 = y # EncryptedScalar<uint6> ∈ [0, 31]
%2 = 2 # ClearScalar<uint2> ∈ [2, 2]
%3 = power(%0, %2) # EncryptedScalar<uint6> ∈ [0, 9]
%4 = add(%3, %1) # EncryptedScalar<uint6> ∈ [1, 39]
return %4In this case, x remains a 2-bit integer, but the Table Lookup result and y are set to 6-bits to allow for the addition.Enabling and disabling multi-precisionThis approach to bit-width assignment is known as multi-precision and is enabled by default. To disable multi-precision and enforce a single precision across the circuit, use the single_precision=True configuration option.PreviousKey-related options for faster executionNextMulti parametersLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# With modules | Concrete

With modules | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCombining compiled functionsWith modulesThis document explains how to compile Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) modules containing multiple functions using Concrete.Deploying a server that contains many compatible functions is important for some use cases. With Concrete, you can compile FHE modules containing as many functions as needed.These modules support the composition of different functions, meaning that the encrypted result of one function can be used as the input for another function without needing to decrypt it first. Additionally, a module is deployed in a single artifact, making it as simple to use as a single-function project.Single inputs / outputsThe following example demonstrates how to create an FHE module: concrete import fhe
@fhe.module()
class Counter:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def inc(x):
return (x + 1) % 20
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def dec(x):
return (x - 1) % 20Then, to compile the Counter module, use the compile method with a dictionary of input-sets for each function:= list(range(20))
CounterFhe = Counter.compile({"inc": inputset, "dec": inputset})After the module is compiled, you can encrypt and call the different functions as follows:x_enc = CounterFhe.inc.encrypt(x)
x_inc_enc = CounterFhe.inc.run(x_enc)
x_inc = CounterFhe.inc.decrypt(x_inc_enc)
assert x_inc == 6
x_inc_dec_enc = CounterFhe.dec.run(x_inc_enc)
x_inc_dec = CounterFhe.dec.decrypt(x_inc_dec_enc)
assert x_inc_dec == 5
for _ in range(10):
x_enc = CounterFhe.inc.run(x_enc)
x_dec = CounterFhe.inc.decrypt(x_enc)
assert x_dec == 15You can generate the keyset beforehand by calling keygen() method on the compiled module:Multi inputs / outputsComposition is not limited to single input / single output. Here is an example that computes the 10 first elements of the Fibonacci sequence in FHE:
def noise_reset(x):
return fhe.univariate(lambda x: x)(x)
@fhe.module()
class Fibonacci:
@fhe.function({"n1th": "encrypted", "nth": "encrypted"})
def fib(n1th, nth):
return noise_reset(nth), noise_reset(n1th + nth)
print("Compiling `Fibonacci` module ...")
inputset = list(zip(range(0, 100), range(0, 100)))
FibonacciFhe = Fibonacci.compile({"fib": inputset})
print("Generating keyset ...")
FibonacciFhe.keygen()
print("Encrypting initial values")
n1th = 1
nth = 2
(n1th_enc, nth_enc) = FibonacciFhe.fib.encrypt(n1th, nth)
print(f"| || (n-1)-th | n-th |")
print(f"| iteration || decrypted | cleartext | decrypted | cleartext |")
for i in range(10):
(n1th_enc, nth_enc) = FibonacciFhe.fib.run(n1th_enc, nth_enc)
(n1th, nth) = Fibonacci.fib(n1th, nth)
# With modules | Concrete
(n1th_dec, nth_dec) = FibonacciFhe.fib.decrypt(n1th_enc, nth_enc)
print(f"| {i} || {n1th_dec:<9} | {n1th:<9} | {nth_dec:<9} | {nth:<9} |")Executing this script will provide the following output:Generating keyset ...
Encrypting initial values
| || (n-1)-th | n-th |

| 8 || 89 | 89 | 144 | 144 |
| 9 || 144 | 144 | 233 | 233 |IterationsModules support iteration with cleartext iterands to some extent, particularly for loops structured like this: # Do something in FHE in the loop body, implemented as an FHE function.Unbounded loops or complex dynamic conditions are also supported, as long as these conditions are computed in pure cleartext in Python. The following example computes the Collatz sequence:
@fhe.module()
class Collatz:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def collatz(x):
y = x // 2
z = 3 * x + 1
is_x_odd = fhe.bits(x)[0]
# With modules | Concrete
ans = fhe.multivariate(lambda b, x: b * x)(is_x_odd, z - y) + y
is_one = ans == 1
return ans, is_one
print("Compiling `Collatz` module ...")
inputset = [i for i in range(63)]
CollatzFhe = Collatz.compile({"collatz": inputset})
print("Generating keyset ...")
CollatzFhe.keygen()
print("Encrypting initial value")
x = 19
x_enc = CollatzFhe.collatz.encrypt(x)
is_one_enc = None
print(f"| decrypted | cleartext |")
while is_one_enc is None or not CollatzFhe.collatz.decrypt(is_one_enc):
x_enc, is_one_enc = CollatzFhe.collatz.run(x_enc)
x, is_one = Collatz.collatz(x)
# With modules | Concrete
x_dec = CollatzFhe.collatz.decrypt(x_enc)
print(f"| {x_dec:<9} | {x:<9} |")This script prints the following output:Generating keyset ...

| 1 | 1 |In this example, a while loop iterates until the decrypted value equals 1. The loop body is implemented in FHE, but the iteration control must be in cleartext.Runtime optimizationBy default, when using modules, all inputs and outputs of every function are compatible, sharing the same precision and crypto-parameters. This approach applies the crypto-parameters of the most costly code path to all code paths. This simplicity may be costly and unnecessary for some use cases.To optimize runtime, we provide finer-grained control over the composition policy via the composition module attribute. Here is an example:
@fhe.module()
class Collatz:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def collatz(x):
y = x // 2
z = 3 * x + 1
is_x_odd = fhe.bits(x)[0]
ans = fhe.multivariate(lambda b, x: b * x)(is_x_odd, z - y) + y
is_one = ans == 1
return ans, is_one
composition = fhe.AllComposable()You have 3 options for the composition attribute:fhe.AllComposable (default): This policy ensures that all ciphertexts used in the module are compatible. It is the least restrictive policy but the most costly in terms of performance.fhe.NotComposable: This policy is the most restrictive but the least costly. It is suitable when you do not need any composition and only want to pack multiple functions in a single artifact.fhe.Wired: This policy allows you to define custom composition rules. You can specify which outputs of a function can be forwarded to which inputs of another function.Note that, in case of complex composition logic another option is to rely on [[composing_functions_with_modules#Automatic module tracing]] to automatically derive the composition from examples.from fhe import Wired, Wire, Output, Input
@fhe.module()
class Collatz:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def collatz(x):
y = x // 2
z = 3 * x + 1
is_x_odd = fhe.bits(x)[0]
ans = fhe.multivariate(lambda b, x: b * x)(is_x_odd, z - y) + y
is_one = ans == 1
return ans, is_one
composition = Wired(
{
Wire(Output(collatz, 0), Input(collatz, 0)
}
)In this case, the policy states that the first output of the collatz function can be forwarded to the first input of collatz, but not the second output (which is decrypted every time, and used for control flow).You can use the fhe.Wire between any two functions. It is also possible to define wires with fhe.AllInputs and fhe.AllOutputs ends. For instance, in the previous example: {
Wire(AllOutputs(collatz), AllInputs(collatz))
}
)This policy would be equivalent to using the fhe.AllComposable policy.Automatic module tracingWhen a module's composition logic is static and straightforward, declaratively defining a Wired policy is usually the simplest approach. However, in cases where modules have more complex or dynamic composition logic, deriving an accurate list of Wire components to be used in the policy can become challenging.Another related problem is defining different function input-sets. When the composition logic is simple, these can be provided manually. But as the composition gets more convoluted, computing a consistent ensemble of inputsets for a module may become intractable.For those advanced cases, you can derive the composition rules and the input-sets automatically from user-provided examples. Consider the following module:from fhe import Wired
@fhe.module()
class MyModule:
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def increment(x):
return (x + 1) % 100
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def decrement(x):
return (x - 1) % 100
@fhe.function({"x": "encrypted"})
def decimate(x):
return (x / 10) % 100
composition = fhe.Wired()You can use the wire_pipeline context manager to activate the module tracing functionality:inputset = [np.random.randint(1, 100, size=()) for _ in range(100)]
# With modules | Concrete
with MyModule.wire_pipeline(inputset) as samples_iter:
# With modules | Concrete
for s in samples_iter:
# With modules | Concrete
MyModule.increment(MyModule.decimate(MyModule.decrement(s)))
# With modules | Concrete
module = MyModule.compile(
p_error=0.01,
)Note that any dynamic branching is possible during module tracing. However, for complex runtime logic, ensure that the input set provides sufficient examples to cover all potential code paths.Current LimitationsDepending on the functions, composition may add a significant overhead compared to a non-composable version.To be composable, a function must meet the following condition: every output that can be forwarded as input (according to the composition policy) must contain a noise-refreshing operation. Since adding a noise refresh has a noticeable impact on performance, Concrete does not automatically include it.For instance, to implement a function that doubles an encrypted value, you might write:class Doubler:
@fhe.compiler({"counter": "encrypted"})
def double(counter):
return counter * 2This function is valid with the fhe.NotComposable policy. However, if compiled with the fhe.AllComposable policy, it will raise a RuntimeError: Program cannot be composed: ..., indicating that an extra Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) step must be added.To resolve this and make the circuit valid, add a PBS at the end of the circuit:class Doubler:
@fhe.compiler({"counter": "encrypted"})
def double(counter):
return fhe.refresh(counter * 2)PreviousWith compositionNextKey-related options for faster executionLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Quick overview | Concrete

Quick overview | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick overviewIn this document, we give a quick overview of the philosophy behind Concrete.FunctionsAvailable FHE-friendly functionsConcrete is a compiler, which aims to turn Python code into its FHE equivalent, in a process which is called the FHE compilation. The best efforts were made to simplify the process: in particular, exceptions apart, the same functions than the Python users are used to use are available. More complete list of available functions is given in the reference section.Levelled vs non-levelled operationsBasically, in the compiled circuit, there will be two kind of operations:levelled operations, which are the additions, subtractions or multiplications by a constant; these operations are also called the linear operationsTable Lookup (TLU) operations, which are used to do anything which is not linear.TLU operations are essential to be able to compile complex functions. We explain their use in different sections of the documentation: direct TLU use or internal use to replace some non-linear functions. We have tools in Concrete to replace univariate or multivariate non-linear functions (ie, functions of one or more inputs) by TLU.TLU are more costly that levelled operations, so we also explain how to limit their impact.Remark that matrix multiplication (aka Gemm -- General Matrix multiplication) and convolutions are levelled operations, since they imply only additions and multiplications by constant.Conditional branches and loopsFunctions can't use conditional branches or non-constant-size loops, unless modules are used. However, control flow statements with constant values are allowed, for example, for i in range(SOME_CONSTANT), if os.environ.get("SOME_FEATURE") == "ON":.DataIntegersIn Concrete, everything needs to be an integer. Users needing floats can quantize to integers before encryption, operate on integers and dequantize to floats after decryption: all of this is done for the user in Concrete ML. However, you can have floating-point intermediate values as long as they can be converted to an integer Table Lookup, for example, (60 * np.sin(x)).astype(np.int64).Scalars and tensorsFunctions can use scalar and tensors. As with Python, it is prefered to use tensorization, to make computations faster.InputsInputs of a compiled function can be either encrypted or clear. Use of clear inputs is however quite limited. Remark that constants can appear in the program without much constraints, they are different from clear inputs which are dynamic.Bit width constraintsBit width of encrypted values has a limit. We are constantly working on increasing the bit width limit. Exceeding this limit will trigger an error.PreviousQuick startNextTerminologyLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

It is used to determine the bit widths and shapes of the variables within the function.The inputset should be an iterable that yields tuples of the same length as the number of arguments of the compiled function.For example:Here, our inputset consists of 10 integer pairs, ranging from a minimum of (0, 0) to a maximum of (7, 7).Choosing a representative inputset is critical to allow the compiler to find accurate bounds of all the intermediate values (see more details here). Evaluating the circuit with input values under or over the bounds may result in undefined behavior.You can use the fhe.inputset(...) function to easily create random inputsets, see more details in this documentation.Compiling the functionUse the compile method of the Compiler class with an inputset to perform the compilation and get the resulting circuit:circuit = compiler.compile(inputset)Generating the keysUse the keygen method of the Circuit class to generate the keys (public and private):circuit.keygen()If you don't call the key generation explicitly, keys will be generated lazily when needed.Performing homomorphic evaluationNow you can easily perform the homomorphic evaluation using the encrypt, run and decrypt methods of the Circuit:encrypted_x, encrypted_y = circuit.encrypt(2, 6)

A circuit includes both client and server components. It has methods for various operations, such as printing and evaluation.Table Lookup (TLU)TLU stands for instructions in the form of y = T[i]. In FHE, this operation is performed with Programmable Bootstrapping, which is the equivalent operation on encrypted values. To learn more about TLU, refer to the Table Lookup basic and tge Table Lookup advanced section.Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS)PBS is equivalent to table lookup y = T[i] on encrypted values, which means that the inputs i and the outputs y are encrypted, but the table T is not encrypted.

Call FHE circuits from other languages | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingCall FHE circuits from other languagesAfter doing a compilation, we end up with a couple of artifacts, including crypto parameters and a binary file containing the executable circuit. In order to be able to encrypt and run the circuit properly, we need to know how to interpret these artifacts, and there are a couple of utility functions which can be used to load them. These utility functions can be accessed through a variety of languages, including Python and C++.DemoWe will use a really simple example for a demo, but the same steps can be done for any other circuit. example.mlir will contain the MLIR below: %0 = "FHELinalg.matmul_eint_int"(%arg0, %arg1): (tensor<4x4x!FHE.eint<6>>, tensor<4x2xi7>) -> (tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<6>>)

return %result: tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<6>>
}You can use the concretecompiler binary to compile this MLIR program. Same can be done with concrete-python, as we only need the compilation artifacts at the end. concretecompiler --action=compile -o python-demo example.mlirYou should be able to see artifacts listed in the python-demo directory ls python-demo/

You will have to create one with the path you used during compilation, then load the result of the compilation= LibrarySupport.new("/path/to/your/python-demo/")
compilation_result = lib_support.reload()Using the compilation result, you can load the server lambda (the entrypoint to the executable compiled circuit) as well as the client parameters (containing crypto parameters)client_params = lib_support.load_client_parameters(compilation_result)The client parameters will serve the client to generate keys and encrypt arguments for the circuitkey_set = client_support.key_set(client_params)

]
encrypted_args = client_support.encrypt_arguments(client_params, key_set, args)Only evaluation keys are required for the execution of the circuit. You can execute the circuit on the encrypted arguments via server_lambda_callencrypted_result = lib_support.server_call(server_lambda, encrypted_args, eval_keys)At this point you have the encrypted result and can decrypt it using the keyset which holds the secret keyprint("result tensor dims: {}".format(result_arg.n_values()))

# MLIR FHE dialects | Concrete

MLIR FHE dialects | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingMLIR FHE dialectsIntroductionCompilation of a Python program starts with Concrete's Python frontend, which first traces and transforms it and then converts it into an intermediate representation (IR) that is further processed by Concrete Compiler. This IR is based on the MLIR subproject of the LLVM compiler infrastructure. This document provides an overview of Concrete's FHE-specific representations based on the MLIR framework.In contrast to traditional infrastructure for compilers, the set of operations and data types that constitute the IR, as well as the level of abstraction that the IR represents, are not fixed in MLIR and can easily be extended. All operations and data types are grouped into dialects, with each dialect representing a specific domain or a specific level of abstraction. Mixing operations and types from different dialects within the same IR is allowed and even encouraged, with all dialects--builtin or developed as an extension--being first-class citizens.Concrete compiler takes advantage of these concepts by defining a set of dialects, capable of representing an FHE program from an abstract specification that is independent of the actual cryptosystem down to a program that can easily be mapped to function calls of a cryptographic library. The dialects for the representation of an FHE program are:The FHELinalg Dialect (documentation, source)The FHE Dialect (documentation, source)The TFHE Dialect (documentation, source)The Concrete Dialect (documentation, source)and for debugging purposes, the Tracing Dialect (documentation, source).In addition, the project further defines two dialects that help expose dynamic task-parallelism and static data-flow graphs in order to benefit from multi-core, multi-accelerator and distributed systems. These are:The RT Dialect (documentation, source) andThe SDFG Dialect (documentation, source).The figure below illustrates the relationship between the dialects and their embedding into the compilation pipeline.The following sections focus on the FHE-related dialects, i.e., on the FHELinalg Dialect, the FHE Dialect, the TFHE Dialect and the Concrete Dialect.The FHE and FHELinalg Dialects: An abstract specification of an FHE programThe top part of the figure shows the components which are involved in the generation of the initial IR, ending with the step labelled MLIR translation. When the initial IR is passed on to Concrete Compiler through its Python bindings, all FHE-related operations are specified using either the FHE or FHELinalg Dialect. Both of these dialects provide operations and data types for the abstract specification of an FHE program, completely independently of a cryptosystem. At this point, the IR simply indicates whether an operand is encrypted (via the type FHE.eint<n>, where n stands for the precision in bits) and what operations are applied to encrypted values. Plaintext values simply use MLIR's builtin integer type in (e.g., i3 or i64).The FHE Dialect provides scalar operations on encrypted integers, such as additions (FHE.add_eint) or multiplications (FHE.mul_eint), while the FHELinalg Dialect offers operations on tensors of encrypted integers, e.g., matrix products (FHELinalg.matmul_eint_eint) or convolutions (FHELinalg.conv2d).In a first lowering step of the pipeline, all FHELinalg operations are lowered to operations from MLIR's builtin Linalg Dialect using scalar operations from the FHE Dialect. Consider the following example, which consists of a function that performs a multiplication of a matrix of encrypted integers and a matrix of cleartext values: %0 = "FHELinalg.matmul_eint_int"(%arg0, %arg1) : (tensor<4x3x!FHE.eint<2>>, tensor<3x2xi3>) -> tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
return %0 : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
}Upon conversion, the FHELinalg.matmul operation is converted to a linalg.generic operation whose body contains a scalar multiplication (FHE.mul_eint_int) and a scalar addition (FHE.add_eint_int):#map1 = affine_map<(d0, d1, d2) -> (d2, d1)>
#map2 = affine_map<(d0, d1, d2) -> (d0, d1)>
func.func @main(%arg0: tensor<4x3x!FHE.eint<2>>, %arg1: tensor<3x2xi3>) -> tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>> {
%0 = "FHE.zero_tensor"() : () -> tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
%1 = linalg.generic {indexing_maps = [#map, #map1, #map2], iterator_types = ["parallel", "parallel", "reduction"]} ins(%arg0, %arg1 : tensor<4x3x!FHE.eint<2>>, tensor<3x2xi3>) outs(%0 : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>) {
^bb0(%in: !FHE.eint<2>, %in_0: i3, %out: !FHE.eint<2>):
%2 = "FHE.mul_eint_int"(%in, %in_0) : (!FHE.eint<2>, i3) -> !FHE.eint<2>
%3 = "FHE.add_eint"(%out, %2) : (!FHE.eint<2>, !FHE.eint<2>) -> !FHE.eint<2>
linalg.yield %3 : !FHE.eint<2>
} -> tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
return %1 : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
}This is then further lowered to a nest of loops from MLIR's SCF Dialect, implementing the parallel and reduction dimensions from the linalg.generic operation above: %c0 = arith.constant 0 : index
%c4 = arith.constant 4 : index
%c1 = arith.constant 1 : index
%c2 = arith.constant 2 : index
%c3 = arith.constant 3 : index
%0 = "FHE.zero_tensor"() : () -> tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
%1 = scf.for %arg2 = %c0 to %c4 step %c1 iter_args(%arg3 = %0) -> (tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>) {
%2 = scf.for %arg4 = %c0 to %c2 step %c1 iter_args(%arg5 = %arg3) -> (tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>) {
%3 = scf.for %arg6 = %c0 to %c3 step %c1 iter_args(%arg7 = %arg5) -> (tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>) {
%extracted = tensor.extract %arg0[%arg2, %arg6] : tensor<4x3x!FHE.eint<2>>
%extracted_0 = tensor.extract %arg1[%arg6, %arg4] : tensor<3x2xi3>
%extracted_1 = tensor.extract %arg7[%arg2, %arg4] : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
%4 = "FHE.mul_eint_int"(%extracted, %extracted_0) : (!FHE.eint<2>, i3) -> !FHE.eint<2>
%5 = "FHE.add_eint"(%extracted_1, %4) : (!FHE.eint<2>, !FHE.eint<2>) -> !FHE.eint<2>
%inserted = tensor.insert %5 into %arg7[%arg2, %arg4] : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
scf.yield %inserted : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
}
scf.yield %3 : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
}
scf.yield %2 : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
}
return %1 : tensor<4x2x!FHE.eint<2>>
}The TFHE Dialect: Binding to the TFHE cryptosystem and parametrizationIn order to obtain an executable program at the end of the compilation pipeline, the abstract specification of the FHE program must at some point be bound to a specific cryptosystem. This is the role of the TFHE Dialect, whose purpose is:to indicate operations to be carried out using an implementation of the TFHE cryptosystemto parametrize the cryptosystem with key sizes, andto provide a mapping between keys and encrypted valuesWhen lowering the IR based on the FHE Dialect to the TFHE Dialect, the compiler first generates a generic form, in which FHE operations are lowered to TFHE operations and where values are converted to unparametrized TFHE.glwe values. The unparametrized form TFHE.glwe<sk?> simply indicates that a TFHE.glwe value is to be used, but without any indication of the cryptographic parameters and the actual key.The IR below shows the example program after lowering to unparametrized TFHE: %c0 = arith.constant 0 : index
%c4 = arith.constant 4 : index
%c1 = arith.constant 1 : index
%c2 = arith.constant 2 : index
%c3 = arith.constant 3 : index
%0 = "TFHE.zero_tensor"() : () -> tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
%1 = scf.for %arg2 = %c0 to %c4 step %c1 iter_args(%arg3 = %0) -> (tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>) {
%2 = scf.for %arg4 = %c0 to %c2 step %c1 iter_args(%arg5 = %arg3) -> (tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>) {
%3 = scf.for %arg6 = %c0 to %c3 step %c1 iter_args(%arg7 = %arg5) -> (tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>) {
%extracted = tensor.extract %arg0[%arg2, %arg6] : tensor<4x3x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
%extracted_0 = tensor.extract %arg1[%arg6, %arg4] : tensor<3x2xi3>
%extracted_1 = tensor.extract %arg7[%arg2, %arg4] : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
%4 = arith.extsi %extracted_0 : i3 to i64
%5 = "TFHE.mul_glwe_int"(%extracted, %4) : (!TFHE.glwe<sk?>, i64) -> !TFHE.glwe<sk?>
%6 = "TFHE.add_glwe"(%extracted_1, %5) : (!TFHE.glwe<sk?>, !TFHE.glwe<sk?>) -> !TFHE.glwe<sk?>
%inserted = tensor.insert %6 into %arg7[%arg2, %arg4] : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
scf.yield %inserted : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
}
scf.yield %3 : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
}
scf.yield %2 : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
}
return %1 : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk?>>
}All operations from the FHE dialect have been replaced with corresponding operations from the TFHE Dialect.During subsequent parametrization, the compiler can either use a set of default parameters or can obtain a set of parameters from Concrete's optimizer. Either way, an additional pass injects the parameters into the IR, replacing all TFHE.glwe<sk?> instances with TFHE.glwe<i,d,n>, where i is a sequential identifier for a key, d the number of GLWE dimensions and n the size of the GLWE polynomial.The result of such a parametrization for the example is given below: %c0 = arith.constant 0 : index
%c4 = arith.constant 4 : index
%c1 = arith.constant 1 : index
%c2 = arith.constant 2 : index
%c3 = arith.constant 3 : index
%0 = "TFHE.zero_tensor"() : () -> tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>>
%1 = scf.for %arg2 = %c0 to %c4 step %c1 iter_args(%arg3 = %0) -> (tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>>) {

%extracted_0 = tensor.extract %arg1[%arg6, %arg4] : tensor<3x2xi3>

%4 = arith.extsi %extracted_0 : i3 to i64
%5 = "TFHE.mul_glwe_int"(%extracted, %4) : (!TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>, i64) -> !TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>
%6 = "TFHE.add_glwe"(%extracted_1, %5) : (!TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>, !TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>) -> !TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>

}

scf.yield %2 : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>>
}
return %1 : tensor<4x2x!TFHE.glwe<sk<0,1,512>>>
}In this parametrization, a single key with the ID 0 is used, with a single dimension and a polynomial of size 512.The Concrete Dialect: Preparing bindings with a crypto libraryIn the next step of the pipeline, operations and types are lowered to the Concrete Dialect. This dialect provides operations, which are implemented by one of Concrete's backend libraries, but still abstracts from any technical details required for interaction with an actual library. The goal is to maintain a high-level representation with value-based semantics and actual operations instead of buffer semantics and library calls, while ensuring that all operations an effectively be lowered to a library call later in the pipeline. However, the abstract types from TFHE are already lowered to tensors of integers with a suitable shape that will hold the binary data of the encrypted values.The result of the lowering of the example to the Concrete Dialect is shown below: %c0 = arith.constant 0 : index
%c4 = arith.constant 4 : index
%c1 = arith.constant 1 : index
%c2 = arith.constant 2 : index
%c3 = arith.constant 3 : index
%generated = tensor.generate {
^bb0(%arg2: index, %arg3: index, %arg4: index):
%c0_i64 = arith.constant 0 : i64
tensor.yield %c0_i64 : i64
} : tensor<4x2x513xi64>
%0 = scf.for %arg2 = %c0 to %c4 step %c1 iter_args(%arg3 = %generated) -> (tensor<4x2x513xi64>) {
%1 = scf.for %arg4 = %c0 to %c2 step %c1 iter_args(%arg5 = %arg3) -> (tensor<4x2x513xi64>) {
%2 = scf.for %arg6 = %c0 to %c3 step %c1 iter_args(%arg7 = %arg5) -> (tensor<4x2x513xi64>) {
%extracted_slice = tensor.extract_slice %arg0[%arg2, %arg6, 0] [1, 1, 513] [1, 1, 1] : tensor<4x3x513xi64> to tensor<513xi64>
%extracted = tensor.extract %arg1[%arg6, %arg4] : tensor<3x2xi3>
%extracted_slice_0 = tensor.extract_slice %arg7[%arg2, %arg4, 0] [1, 1, 513] [1, 1, 1] : tensor<4x2x513xi64> to tensor<513xi64>
%3 = arith.extsi %extracted : i3 to i64
%4 = "Concrete.mul_cleartext_lwe_tensor"(%extracted_slice, %3) : (tensor<513xi64>, i64) -> tensor<513xi64>
%5 = "Concrete.add_lwe_tensor"(%extracted_slice_0, %4) : (tensor<513xi64>, tensor<513xi64>) -> tensor<513xi64>
%inserted_slice = tensor.insert_slice %5 into %arg7[%arg2, %arg4, 0] [1, 1, 513] [1, 1, 1] : tensor<513xi64> into tensor<4x2x513xi64>

}
scf.yield %1 : tensor<4x2x513xi64>
}
return %0 : tensor<4x2x513xi64>
}Bufferization and emitting library callsThe remaining stages of the pipeline are rather technical. Before any binding to an actual Concrete backend library, the compiler first invokes MLIR's bufferization infrastructure to convert the value-based IR into an IR with buffer semantics. In particular, this means that keys and encrypted values are no longer abstract values in a mathematical sense, but values backed by a memory location that holds the actual data. This form of IR is then suitable for a pass emitting actual library calls that implement the corresponding operations from the Concrete Dialect for a specific backend.The result for the example is given below: %c0_i64 = arith.constant 0 : i64
call @_dfr_start(%c0_i64, %arg2) : (i64, !Concrete.context) -> ()
%c0 = arith.constant 0 : index
%c4 = arith.constant 4 : index
%c1 = arith.constant 1 : index
%c2 = arith.constant 2 : index
%c513 = arith.constant 513 : index
%c0_i64_0 = arith.constant 0 : i64
%c3 = arith.constant 3 : index
%alloc = memref.alloc() {alignment = 64 : i64} : memref<4x2x513xi64>

Each sub-project have is own README that explain how to setup the developer environment, how to build it and how to run tests commands.Concrete is made of 4 main categories of sub-project that are organized in subdirectories from the root of the Concrete repo:frontends contains high-level transpilers that target end users developers who want to use the Concrete stack easily from their usual environment. There are for now only one frontend provided by the Concrete project: a Python frontend named concrete-python.compilers contains the sub-projects in charge of actually solving the compilation problem of an high-level abstraction of FHE to an actual executable. concrete-optimizer is a Rust based project that solves the optimization problems of an FHE dag to a TFHE dag and concrete-compiler which use concrete-optimizer is an end-to-end MLIR-based compiler that takes a crypto free FHE dialect and generates compilation artifacts both for the client and the server. concrete-compiler project provide in addition of the compilation engine, a client and server library in order to easily play with the compilation artifacts to implement a client and server protocol.backends contains CAPI that can be called by the concrete-compiler runtime to perform the cryptographic operations. There are currently two backends:concrete-cpu, using TFHE-rs that implement the fastest implementation of TFHE on CPU.concrete-cuda that provides a GPU acceleration of TFHE primitives.tools are basically every other sub-projects that cannot be classified in the three previous categories and which are used as a common support by the others.Concrete Python layoutThe module structure of Concrete Python.

# Optimizer | Concrete

Optimizer | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingOptimizerconcrete-optimizer is a tool that selects appropriate cryptographic parameters for a given fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) computation. These parameters have an impact on the security, correctness, and efficiency of the computation.The computation is guaranteed to be secure with the given level of security (see here for details) which is typically 128 bits. The correctness of the computation is guaranteed up to a given failure probability. A surrogate of the execution time is minimized which allows for efficient FHE computation.The cryptographic parameters are degrees of freedom in the FHE algorithms (bootstrapping, keyswitching, etc.) that need to be fixed. The search space for possible crypto-parameters is finite but extremely large. The role of the optimizer is to quickly find the most efficient crypto-parameters possible while guaranteeing security and correctness.Security, Correctness, and EfficiencySecurityThe security level is chosen by the user. We typically operate at a fixed security level, such as 128 bits, to ensure that there is never a trade-off between security and efficiency. This constraint imposes a minimum amount of noise in all ciphertexts.An independent public research tool, the lattice estimator, is used to estimate the security level. The lattice estimator is maintained by FHE experts. For a given set of crypto-parameters, this tool considers all possible attacks and returns a security level.For each security level, a parameter curve of the appropriate minimal error level is pre-computed using the lattice estimator, and is used as an input to the optimizer. Learn more about the parameter curves here.CorrectnessCorrectness decreases as the level of noise increases. Noise accumulates during homomorphic computation until it is actively reduced via bootstrapping. Too much noise can lead to the result of a computation being inaccurate or completely incorrect.Before optimization, we compute a noise bound that guarantees a given error level (under the assumption that noise growth is correctly managed via bootstrapping). The noise growth depends on a critical quantity: the 2-norm of any dot product (or equivalent) present in the calculus. This 2-norm changes the scale of the noise, so we must reduce it sufficiently for the next dot product operation whenever we reduce the noise.The user can control error probability in two ways: via the PBS error probability and the global error probability.The PBS error probability controls correctness locally (i.e., represents the error probability of a single PBS operation), while the global error probability focuses on the overall computation result (i.e., represents the error probability of the entire computation). These probabilities are related, and choosing which one to use may depend on the specific use case.EfficiencyEfficiency decreases as more precision is required, e.g. 7-bits versus 8-bits. The larger the 2-norm is, the bigger the noise will be after a dot product. To remain below the noise bound, we must ensure that the inputs to the dot product have a sufficiently small noise level. The smaller this noise is, the slower the previous bootstrapping will be. Therefore, the larger the 2norm is, the slower the computation will be.How are the parameters optimizedThe optimization prioritizes security and correctness. This means that the security level (or the probability of correctness) could, in practice, be a bit higher than the level which is requested by the user.In the simplest case, the optimizer performs an exhaustive search in the full parameter space and selects the best solution. While the space to explore is huge, exact lower bound cuts are used to avoid exploring regions which are guaranteed to not contain an optimal point. This makes the process both fast and exhaustive. This case is called mono-parameter, where all parameters are shared by the whole computation graph.In more complex cases, the optimizer iteratively performs an exhaustive search, with lower bound cuts in a wide subspace of the full parameter space, until it converges to a locally optimal solution. Since the wide subspace is large and multi-dimensional, it should not be trapped in a poor locally optimal solution. The more complex case is called multi-parameter, where different calculus operations have tailored parameters.How can I determine, understand, and explore crypto-parametersOne can have a look at reference crypto-parameters for each security level (but for a given correctness). This provides insight between the calcululs content (i.e. maximum precision, maximum dot 2-norm, etc.,) and the cost.Then one can manually explore crypto-parameters space using a CLI tool.CitingIf you use this tool in your work, please cite:Bergerat, Loris and Boudi, Anas and Bourgerie, Quentin and Chillotti, Ilaria and Ligier, Damien and Orfila Jean-Baptiste and Tap, Samuel, Parameter Optimization and Larger Precision for (T)FHE, Journal of Cryptology, 2023, Volume 36A pre-print is available as Cryptology ePrint Archive Paper 2022/704PreviousAdding a new backendNextMLIR FHE dialectsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

When you are happy with the state of the release branch, you need to update the API documentation:If you miss it, the release worflow will stops on the release-checks steps on concrete_python_release.yml. Don't forget to push the updated API docs in the branch.Then you just need to tag. tag vMAJOR.MINOR.REVISION
git push origin vMAJOR.MINOR.REVISIONThis new tag push will start the release workflow: the workflow builds all release artifacts then create a new draft release on GitHub which you can find at https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/releases/tag/vMAJOR.MINOR.REVISION.You should edit the changelog and the release documentation, then make it reviewed by the product marketing team.Create a new official releaseWhen the new release documentation has been reviewed, you may save the release as a non draft release, then publish wheels on pypi using the https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/actions/workflows/push_wheels_to_public_pypi.yml workflow, by setting the version number as MAJOR.MINOR.VERSION.Artifacts to checkFollow the summary checklist:Create release branch git branch release/MAJOR.MINOR.x or pull git pull release/MAJOR.MINOR.x.Cherry pick commits for the new release git branch release/MAJOR.MINOR.x.Update documentation ./ci/scripts/make_apidoc.sh(if diff) git commit -m "doc(frontend-python): Update API documentation for vMAJOR.MINOR.x"Update release branch git push origin release/MAJOR.MINOR.xTag the new version git tag vMAJOR.MINOR.REVISION && git push origin vMAJOR.MINOR.REVISIONWait the end of the https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/actions/workflows/concrete_python_release.yml buildEdit and publish the Github release note https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/releases/tag/vMAJOR.MINOR.REVISIONThen publish wheels on public PyPI using manually the workflow https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/actions/workflows/push_wheels_to_public_pypi.ymlAt the end, check all the artifacts:Release branch https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/tree/release/MAJOR.MINOR.x,Github release note https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/releases/tag/vMAJOR.MINOR.REVISION (publicly released),Public PyPy wheels https://pypi.org/project/concrete-python/MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION/Documentation up-to-date https://docs.zama.ai/concreteZama PyPi CPU wheels https://pypi.zama.ai/cpu/concrete-python/index.htmlZama PyPi GPU wheels https://pypi.zama.ai/gpu/concrete-python/index.htmlDocker images https://hub.docker.com/r/zamafhe/concrete-python/tagsPreviousExamplesLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Adding a new backend | Concrete

Adding a new backend | ConcretePart I: Concrete - FHE compilerPart II: The Architecture of ConcreteRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingCompiler backendAdding a new backendContextThe Concrete backends are implementations of the cryptographic primitives of the Zama variant of TFHE.There are client features (private and public key generation, encryption and decryption) and server features (homomorphic operations on ciphertexts using public keys).Considering thatperformance improvements are mostly beneficial for the server operationsthe client needs to be portable for the variety of clients that may exist, we expect mostly server backend to be added to the compiler to improve performance (e.g. by using specialized hardware)What is needed in the server backendThe server backend should expose C or C++ functions to do TFHE operations using the current ciphertext and key memory representation (or functions to change representation). A backend can support only a subset of the current TFHE operations.The most common operations one would be expected to add are WP-PBS (standard TFHE programmable bootstrap), keyswitch and WoP (without padding bootsrap).Linear operations may also be supported but may need more work since their introduction may interfere with other compilation passes. The following example does not include this.Concrete-cuda exampleWe will detail how concrete-cuda is integrated in the compiler. Adding a new server feature backend (for non linear operations) should be quite similar. However, if you want to integrate a backend but it does not fit with this description, please open an issue or contact us to discuss the integration.In compilers/concrete-compiler/Makefilethe variable CUDA_SUPPORT has been added and set to OFF (CUDA_SUPPORT?=OFF) by defaultthe variables CUDA_SUPPORT and CUDA_PATH are passed to CMake-DCUDAToolkit_ROOT=$(CUDA_PATH)In compilers/concrete-compiler/compiler/include/concretelang/Runtime/context.h, the RuntimeContext struct is enriched with state to manage the backend ressources (behind a #ifdef CONCRETELANG_CUDA_SUPPORT).In compilers/concrete-compiler/compiler/lib/Runtime/wrappers.cpp, the cuda backend server functions are added (behind a #ifdef CONCRETELANG_CUDA_SUPPORT)The pass ConcreteToCAPI is modified to have a flag to insert calls to these new wrappers instead of the cpu ones (the code calling this pass is modified accordingly).It may be possible to replace the cpu wrappers (with a compilation flag) instead of adding new ones to avoid having to change the pass.In compilers/concrete-compiler/CMakeLists.txt a Section #Concrete Cuda Configuration has been added Other CMakeLists.txt have also been modified (or added) with if(CONCRETELANG_CUDA_SUPPORT) guard to handle header includes, linking...PreviousCompiler backendNextOptimizerLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Usually when you extract the lsb bit, you also need to extract the next one.
In that case you first need to clear the first lsb of the input to be able to reduce its precision and extract the next one.
To be able to clear the lsb just extracted, you can get it in the original precision.
Example:
```mlir
// Extracting the first lsb with original precision
%lsb_0 = "FHE.lsb"(%input): (!FHE.eint<4>) -> (!FHE.eint<4>)
// Clearing the first lsb from original input
%input_lsb0_cleared = "FHE.sub_eint"(%input, %lsb_0) : (!FHE.eint<4>, !FHE.eint<4>) -> (!FHE.eint<4>)
// Reducing the precision of the input
%input_3b = "FHE.reinterpret_precision(%input) : (!FHE.eint<4>) -> !FHE.eint<3>
// Now, we can do it again with the second lsb
%lsb_1 = "FHE.lsb"(%input_3b): (!FHE.eint<3>) -> (!FHE.eint<3>)
...
// later if you need %b_lsb at same position as in the input
%lsb_1_at_input_position = "FHE.reinterpret_precision(%b_lsb)" : (!FHE.eint<3>) -> !FHE.eint<4>

e.g.,
arg0: tensor<MxN> = [...]
arg1: tensor<NxP> = [...]
result: tensor<MxP> = [...]
- If the first argument is a vector (1-D),
it is treated as a matrix with a single row and standard matrix multiplication is performed.
After standard matrix multiplication,
the first dimension is removed from the result.
e.g.,
arg0: tensor<3> = [x, y, z]
arg1: tensor<3xM> = [
[_, _, ..., _, _],
[_, _, ..., _, _],
[_, _, ..., _, _],
]
is treated as
arg0: tensor<1x3> = [
[x, y, z]
]
arg1: tensor<3xM> = [
[_, _, ..., _, _],
[_, _, ..., _, _],
[_, _, ..., _, _],
]
and matrix multiplication is performed with the following form (1x3 @ 3xM -> 1xM)
result: tensor<1xM> = [[_, _, ..., _, _]]
finally, the first dimension is removed by definition so the result has the following form
result: tensor<M> = [_, _, ..., _, _]
- If the second argument is 1-D,
it is treated as a matrix with a single column and standard matrix multiplication is performed.
After standard matrix multiplication,
the last dimension is removed from the result.
e.g.,
arg0: tensor<Mx3> = [
[_, _, _],
[_, _, _],
...,
[_, _, _],
[_, _, _],
]

To read Zama's FHEVM technical whitepaper, please see on Github.The blockchain confidentiality dilemmaWhy do we need blockchain? This question often comes along when discussing building decentralized applications (dapps). After all, most things we use today are not blockchain based and work just fine. However, there are some applications where the cost of blindly trusting a third party and being wrong is too high, such as when dealing with financial assets, identity or governance. In those cases, consumers and companies want strong guarantees that whatever service is being provided is done correctly, while service providers want to ensure their users have the right to use the assets/data they claim.Blockchains solve this by enabling anyone to publicly verify that a request was executed according to a predetermined logic, and that the resulting state of the overall system is correct. Service providers and their customers no longer have to trust each other, as the integrity of the transaction is guaranteed by the blockchain itself.One major issue with public verifiability however is that it requires disclosing all the transactions and data to everyone, as keeping them private would prevent verifiability in the first place. This lack of confidentiality has been a major hindrance to global adoption of blockchains, as the very data it is supposed to be used for (money, identity, …) is highly sensitive by nature. Without confidentiality, blockchain cannot reach mass adoption.The Zama Confidential Blockchain ProtocolThe Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol (or simply the Zama Protocol) enables confidential smart contracts on top of any L1 or L2. It is the most advanced confidentiality protocol to date, offering:End-to-end encryption of transaction inputs and state: no-one can see the data, not even node operators.Composability between confidential contracts, as well as with non-confidential ones. Developers can build on top of other contracts, tokens and dapps.Programmable confidentiality: smart contracts define who can decrypt what, meaning developers have full control over confidentiality rules in their applications.The Zama Protocol is not a new L1 or L2, but rather a cross-chain confidentiality layer sitting on top of existing chains. As such, users don’t need to bridge to a new chain and can interact with confidential dapps from wherever they choose.It leverages Zama’s state-of-the-art Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, which enables computing directly on encrypted data. FHE has long been considered the “holy grail” of cryptography, as it allows end-to-end encryption for any application, onchain or offchain. We believe that just like the internet went from zero encryption with HTTP to encrypting data in transit with HTTPS, the next natural step will be to use FHE to enable end-to-end encryption by default in every application, something we call HTTPZ.Until recently however, FHE was too slow, too limited in terms of applications it could support, and too difficult to use for developers. This is what our team at Zama has spent the last 5 years solving. We now have a highly efficient FHE technology that can support any type of application, using common programming languages such as Solidity and Python, while being over 100x faster than 5 years ago. Importantly, Zama’s FHE technology is already post-quantum, meaning there is no known quantum algorithms that can break it.While FHE is the core technology used in the Zama Protocol, we also leverage Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) to address the shortcomings of other confidentiality solutions:FHE enables confidentiality while being fully publicly verifiable (anyone can recompute the FHE operations and verify them). Using GPUs will soon allow scaling to 100+ transactions/s while dedicated hardware accelerators (FPGAs and ASICs) will enable scaling to thousands of transactions per second.MPC enables decentralizing the global network key, ensuring no single party can access it. Using MPC only to generate keys and decrypt data for users minimizes latency and communication, thereby making it far more scalable and decentralized than using it for private computation.ZK ensures the encrypted inputs provided by users were actually encrypted correctly. Using ZK only for this specific purpose makes the ZK proofs lightweight and cheap to generate in a browser or mobile app.The table below summarizes the advantages of the Zama Protocol versus other technologies used in confidential blockchain protocols:Secure✅✅✅✅❌✅Decentralized✅✅✅✅✅❌Verifiable✅✅❌✅❌❌Composable✅✅✅❌✅✅Scalable✅❌✅✅✅✅Easy to use✅❌❌❌✅✅RoadmapThe Zama Protocol leverages years of research and development work done at Zama. The testnet is already live, and the mainnet is planned for 2025, with a TGE at the end of the year. The timeline is as follows:Public Testnet (already live). This will allow anyone to deploy and test their confidential dapps, as well as enabling operators to coordinate and get used to the operations.Ethereum Mainnet (Q4 2025). This will be the first official mainnet bringing confidentiality to Ethereum. Only apps that have been approved by Zama will be available at first.TGE + other EVM chains (End of Year). Towards the end of the year, we will launch the $ZAMA token and add more EVM chains to the Zama protocol. Anyone will be able to deploy dapps, permissionlessly.Solana support (2026). After an initial phase of EVM-only support, we will deploy the Zama Protocol on Solana, enabling confidential SVM applications.Use casesConfidential smart contracts enable a new design space for blockchain applications, in particular when applied to finance, identity and governance. If we look at web2, it is clear that most applications do not share all the data publicly, and thus it is likely that the vast majority of blockchain applications are yet to be built, now that confidentiality is no longer an issue.Here are some example use cases:FinanceConfidential payments. Stablecoins are one the most successful use case for blockchain, with trillions in yearly volume. Everything from credit card payments to salaries, remittances and banking rails is now moving onchain. One of the absolute key requirement however is confidentiality and compliance. Thanks to FHE and the Zama Protocol, this is now possible: balances and transfer amounts are kept encrypted end-to-end, while payment providers can embed compliance features into the token contract directly. You can read more about confidential, compliant payments here.Tokenization & RWAs. The tokenization of financial assets is one of the main adoption drivers of blockchain for large institutions. From fund shares to stocks, bonds or derivatives, there is up to $100T of assets that could potentially move onchain. Due to confidentiality and compliance issues however, TradFi institutions have had to rely on private blockchains, making it difficult to ensure interoperability between institutions. With the Zama Protocol, they can now use existing public blockchain such as Ethereum or Solana to tokenize and trade their assets, while keeping their activity and investor identity confidential. They can also ensure KYC/AML checks are done in the smart contracts directly, without revealing sensitive information to others. You can read more about this use case in the report published by JP Morgan - Kynexis, in which they built a proof-of-concept using Zama’s technology.Confidential DeFi. DeFi has redefined finance by allowing anyone to participate and earn yield, but it suffers from two major issues: people don’t like sharing how much they own, and bots front-running transactions makes it expensive for end users to swap assets onchain. FHE can solve both issues by enabling end-to-end encrypted swaps, where the amount and possibly asset is kept private at all times. Some other use cases includes confidential lending, onchain credit scoring, option pricing and more.TokensSealed-bid auctions. Sell assets such as NFTs or tokens in an onchain sealed-bid auction. Each participant places an encrypted bid onchain. When the auction ends, the highest bidder(s) win the item(s), without revealing any of the bids. Not only does this enable better price discovery, it also prevents bots from stealing the auction by monitoring the mempool. This is a particularly effective method for public token sales.Confidential distributions. Distributing tokens currently requires disclosing publicly how much each address receives. Whether it’s for airdrops, grants, investors or developers, keeping the distributed amounts private is paramount to privacy and security onchain. With FHE, protocols can distribute their token confidentially, run vesting on those encrypted tokens, enable confidential staking and more.Identity and GovernanceComposable onchain identity. Offchain, we use our identities all the time, from buying products online to booking plane tickets. Doing so onchain however would leak sensitive information such as your name, address, social security number and more. With FHE however, you can have a complete Decentralized ID (DID) + Verifiable Credentials (VC) system onchain, where your identity is encrypted while being fully composable with decentralized applications. Just like you can have account abstraction, you can now have identity abstraction. This is also essential for compliance in onchain payments and tokenization, as it can be used by smart contracts to verify claims in a decentralized, private manner.Confidential governance. The idea of onchain voting, whether for DAOs, companies or governments, has been explored for as long as blockchains exist. But having the votes cast publicly onchain can lead to biases, blackmailing, or bribing. With FHE, votes (and numbers of tokens staked) can be kept private, ensuring only the final tally is revealed, and not the individual votes.Other examplesOnchain corporations. Managing a company onchain would be impossible without the promise of confidentiality. Indeed, information such as the cap table, financials, board votes, customers, and employee registers should not be disclosed publicly. With FHE, all this information could be kept onchain, allowing smart contracts to automate many day-to-day company operations. ‍‍Prediction markets. ‍‍Prediction markets are based on the wisdom of the crowd concept: the average prediction of a large number of people tend to be close to the correct outcome. However, this only works if participants are not biased by previous predictions. The Zama Protocol solves this by enabling prediction markets where predictions are encrypted until revealed periodically, leading to better precision in outcomes.Data marketplaces for AI. ‍‍AI strives on data. With FHE, users can selectively share and sell their data with companies wishing to train AI models. More than this, models can potentially be trained encrypted, with only the result being decrypted, ensuring that users have a constant stream of revenue for their data vs selling it only once and it being used forever.These are just some examples of what can be done today. We believe that FHE, through Zama’s Protocol, will enable unprecedented liquidity, enabling users and companies to move onchain. With time and scale, it would even become possible to run entire companies, cities or even countries onchain, including their financial and identity infrastructure, elections, currency, taxes, land, car and company registries. Confidential blockchains don’t just enable programmable money: they enable programmable public infrastructure.Creating confidential applicationsCreating a confidential dapp using existing solutions often requires learning a new (niche) programming language, using dedicated (and often limited) developer tools, and mastering advanced cryptographic concepts.The Zama Protocol on the other hand enables developers to create confidential dapps directly in Solidity, without any knowledge of cryptography. Developers simply need to import our library (called FHEVM) and write their logic using the provided operators. You can get started today for free by checking out the developer documentation here.The following example shows an example confidential token contract, which can be deployed on any supported chain such as Ethereum.
import "fhevm/lib/FHE.sol";
import { IConfidentialFungibleToken } from "./IConfidentialFungibleToken.sol";
abstract contract ConfidentialFungibleToken is IConfidentialFungibleToken {
uint64 internal _totalSupply;
string internal _name;
string internal _symbol;
// Balances are encrypted
mapping(address account => euint64 balance) internal _balances;
// Transfer an encrypted amount
function transfer(address to, externalEuint64 encryptedAmount, bytes calldata inputProof) public virtual returns (euint64) {
// Verify the input is correct and cast to euint64
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
// Check if the user has enough balance, otherwise set the transfer amount to zero
euint64 transferValue = FHE.select(FHE.le(amount, _balances[msg.sender]), amount, FHE.asEuint64(0));
// Make the transfer
_balances[to] = FHE.add(_balances[to], transferValue);
_balances[from] = FHE.sub(_balances[from], transferValue);
// Allow users to see their balances, and the contract to update it
FHE.allow(_balances[to], to);
FHE.allow(_balances[from], from);
FHE.allowThis(_balances[to]);
FHE.allowThis(_balances[from]);
return transferValue;
}
}Simply replace the integer operations by their FHE equivalent, then specify who can decrypt the balances. Of course, developers can build much more complicated applications, such as AMMs, lending, and more. On top of the smart contract library, we also provide a Javascript SDK that streamlines the encryption and decryption client-side, making it almost invisible to end-users.The access control system used by the Zama Protocol is extremely powerful. By allowing contracts to define who can decrypt which value in it, it makes confidentiality (and compliance) fully programmable. There is no assumption at the protocol or user level, everything is encoded in the application logic itself, allowing companies to choose whether they want to offer end-to-end encryption (aka nobody sees anything, not even the companies building the dapp), or onchain encryption (aka the web2 model: only the user and service provider see the data, but nobody else onchain).The FHEVM library used by the Zama Protocol supports the following encrypted types and operations:TypeSymbolLogicalArithmeticComparisonShiftsBranchingInteger (unsigned)euint8…256and, or, xor, notadd, sub, mul, div, rem, neg, abs, signeq, neq, gt, lt, ge, le, min, maxshl, shr, rotl, rotrselectInteger (signed)eint8…256and, or, xor, notadd, sub, mul, div, rem, neg, abs, signeq, neq, gt, lt, ge, le, min, maxshl, shr, rotl, rotrselectBooleanebooland, or, xor, noteq, neqselectBytesebytes1…256and, or, xor, noteq, neqshl, shr, rotl, rotrselectAddresseaddresseq, neqselectTo make deploying dapps easier, we are also building a “Zama Standard Library”: a set of audited, highly optimized smart contracts for common use cases such as:confidential tokens and RWAsconfidential NFTswrappers to bridge between confidential assets and traditional onesa confidential identity stack that enables DID/VC onchainUniV2-style confidential AMMsConfidential vestingConfidential airdropsSealed-bid auctionsConfidential governanceWe will continue adding more over time as we see new use cases appearing.Technical detailsBlockchains typically only support limited computations, making it impossible to run FHE natively on Ethereum and other L1/L2s. To address this issue, we designed the Zama Protocol based on two core ideas: symbolic execution and threshold decryption.‍Symbolic executionThe idea behind symbolic execution is that whenever a contract calls the Zama FHEVM Solidity library on the host chain (the L1/L2 where the confidential dapp is deployed) to perform an FHE operation, the host chain itself doesn’t do any actual FHE computation; instead, it produces a pointer to the result and emits an event to notify a network of coprocessors, who do the actual FHE computation. This has many advantages:The host chain does not need to change anything, run expensive FHE operations or use specific hardware.The host chain is not slowed down by FHE, so non-FHE transactions can be executed as fast as they always have beenFHE operations can be executed in parallel, rather than sequentially, dramatically increasing throughput.Since all ciphertexts on the host chain are simply pointers (the actual data is stored by coprocessors), FHE operations can be chained just like regular operations, without needing to wait for the previous ones to complete. The only time we need to wait for a ciphertext to be computed is when it has to be decrypted.From a security perspective, everything the coprocessors do is publicly verifiable, and anyone can just recompute the ciphertexts to verify the result. Initially, we use multiple coprocessors with a majority consensus, but longer term the goal is to enable anyone to compete to execute FHE operations, leveraging ZK-FHE to prove the correctness.Threshold decryptionTo maintain composability onchain, all ciphertexts need to be encrypted under the same public key. This means the private decryption key has to be secured in a way that prevents illegitimate decryption of ciphertexts. The Zama Protocol solves this by splitting the private key amongst multiple parties, using a dedicated threshold MPC protocol as its Key Management Service (KMS).In order for a user or contract to decrypt a value, they need to first have been explicitly allowed to do so by the contract that produced the value on the host chain. Decrypting the result is then a simple request to the Zama Gateway, which acts as an orchestrator for the protocol and forwards the request to the KMS parties.This again ensures that all decryption requests are publicly visible, and thus anyone can verify they match the access control logic defined by smart contracts.ComponentsThe Zama Protocol is composed of several core components:Host Chains: the L1s and L2s that are supported by the Zama Protocol, and on which developers deploy their confidential dapps.FHEVM Library: the library that developers use to create confidential smart contracts.FHEVM Executor: the contract that is called by dapps to execute FHE operations on the Host Chain. Each time a contract uses an FHE operation, the Executor automatically emits an event to notify Coprocessors to compute it.Access Control List (ACL): a smart contract deployed on each Host Chain, which keeps tracks of who can decrypt what. The ACL is central to the operations of the Zama Protocol and is used both to verify a contract is allowed to compute on an encrypted value, and that an address is allowed to decrypt it. Each time a contract allows an address to use a ciphertext, an event is emitted and relayed by Coprocessors to the Gateway, enabling the aggregation of all Host Chain ACLs into a single Gateway ACL used by the KMS to authenticate decryption requests.$ZAMA token: the native token of the Zama Protocol, used for payment of the fees, staking and governance.Gateway: a set of smart contracts used to orchestrate the Zama Protocol, and allow users to request verification of their encrypted inputs, decryption of ciphertexts and bridging of encrypted assets between Host Chains. Each of these operations is a transaction to the Gateway contracts, and requires paying a small fee in $ZAMA tokens. While the Gateway contracts could be deployed on any L1 or L2, we opted to run a dedicated Arbitrum rollup for the Zama Protocol, ensuring maximal performance and cost efficiency. Note that our rollup serves only the Zama Protocol and doesn’t allow third party contracts to be deployed on it.Coprocessors: a set of nodes responsible for 1. verifying encrypted inputs from users, 2. running the actual FHE computations and storing the resulting ciphertexts, 3. relaying ACL events to the Gateway. The Zama Protocol uses multiple coprocessors, which each commit their results to the Gateway, which in turns runs a majority consensus. All tasks performed by the coprocessors are publicly verifiable. Coprocessors can be vertically and horizontally scaled based on throughput requirements of the various confidential dapps.Key Management Service (KMS): a set of nodes running various Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols for key generation, CRS generation and threshold decryption. The KMS ensures that no single party can ever access the decryption keys. KMS nodes are orchestrated by the Gateway, ensuring all operations are publicly visible. Furthermore, all KMS nodes must run the MPC software inside AWS Nitro Enclaves, making it harder for operators to leak their shares while providing some level of integrity on the MPC computation. Eventually, our goal will be to use ZK-MPC to enable verifiability without hardware assumptions.Operators: a set of entities that run the Zama Protocol nodes. This includes Coprocessors and KMS nodes.The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a confidential token transfer across the various components.PerformanceThe Zama Protocol is designed to be horizontally scalable, leveraging our cutting-edge TFHE-rs library. Contrary to the sequential behavior of the EVM, the Zama Protocol parallelizes the computation of FHE operations. As long as a specific ciphertext isn’t used in a sequential chain of FHE operations, Coprocessors will be able to increase the throughput simply by adding more servers.Since we started working on the Zama Protocol, we have been able to increase throughput exponentially from 0.5 transactions per second to over 20 transactions per second. Note that this throughput is per Host Chain, which means that the Zama Protocol can already theoretically support hundreds of transactions per second across all Host Chains. While this is enough to cover most EVM chains (Ethereum does ~15 tps), it is still insufficient for retail payments (VISA does 25,000 tps) and for Solana (1,000+ tps).To bridge that gap, we will progressively move to more and more powerful hardware. First, we will move from CPU to GPU, increasing throughput per chain to over ~50-100 tps (assuming state-independent transactions). Then we will leverage our recently open-sourced FPGA accelerator, targeting 500-1000 tps / chain. Finally, using dedicated hardware accelerators (ASICs) will enable 10,000+ tps / chain.The important point here is that FHE is no longer limited by underlying algorithms, and is now mostly driven by Moore’s law: the better the hardware, the better the throughput of the Zama Protocol.SecurityThe Zama Protocol uses a defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple techniques to ensure maximum security:We use 128 bits of security and a p-fail of 2^-128 for all FHE operations. This is far more than any other FHE scheme used in blockchain currently. Furthermore, our FHE scheme is post-quantum, meaning it is secure even against quantum computers.All the FHE operations are publicly verifiable, allowing anyone to recompute the result and identify malicious FHE nodes. This is akin to optimistic rollup security, but for FHE computation. Furthermore, we don’t run a single FHE node, but rather have 3 operators run FHE nodes and sign their outputs, allowing to have both optimistic security and consensus on the result.We use 13 nodes with a 2/3 majority rule for all our MPC protocols, while most other projects only use 3 to 5 nodes. Furthermore, our MPC protocol is robust, meaning it will give a correct output with up to 1/3 malicious nodes. As far as we know, this is the first implementation in production of a robust MPC protocol.Additionally, our MPC protocol runs inside AWS Nitro Enclaves, adding a layer of defense in depth and preventing access to the underlying share of the FHE private key from outside the protocol. The enclave also offers an attestation of the software version the MPC nodes are running, allowing the protocol to keep track of software updates. The combination of MPC and Nitro enclaves means recovering the shares and using them outside of the protocol would require AWS and multiple MPC nodes to collude.Genesis operators are highly reputable organizations with billions at stake through their non-Zama activities, whether as professional validators, infrastructure providers, businesses, or other. As they are all doxxed, anyone can see if they misbehaved. This brings economic security beyond their on-chain stake, as being caught misbehaving in the Zama Protocol will likely impact their other activities.Slashing is done via governance, allowing anyone to suggest a recourse if they identify bad behavior in an operator. This offers greater flexibility by allowing to capture edge cases and treat issues on a case per case basis.The Zama Protocol is being audited by Trail of Bits and Zenith. This is one of the largest audits of a crypto protocol, with over 34 audit-weeks spent on it so far.ComplianceBuilding confidential applications often requires complying with local regulations. For example, financial institutions need to know who their customers are, verify that they are eligible to access specific financial instruments, that they are not blacklisted etc.Contrary to many blockchain confidentiality protocols that puts the burden of compliance on the end-users, the Zama Protocol enables applications to define their own compliance rules directly within their smart contracts.The ability to have “programmable compliance” is a key advantage offered by FHE, and means that the protocol itself has no say on who can access which encrypted value. Developers decide what is best for their applications, not the Zama Protocol.Future ImprovementsThe Zama Protocol is the most advanced confidentiality protocol to date, and can already scale to address most blockchain use cases. Nonetheless, there are several areas of improvements we are working on to make it even more decentralized, secure and scalable. These typically rely on a combination of better hardware, better algorithms, and ZK-ifying everything:Reaching 10,000+ tpsNew FHE techniques: we are constantly inventing new FHE techniques that improve performance. We expect the base algorithms to improve by 10-20x over the coming years, similar to the performance gains ZK had in the past few years.FHE ASICs: we are working with several companies on accelerating FHE with dedicated hardware. The goal is to make FHE 100x-1000x faster using ASICs, in the same way Bitcoin mining or AI has been improved with dedicated hardware. We expect the first accelerators to be available in 2027-2028.ZK-rollup Gateway: the Gateway currently uses an optimistic rollup. Our goal is to move to a ZK rollup and improve the performance to support tens of thousands of transactions per second with a latency of less than 100ms.Making the KMS even more bullet-proofZK-MPC: currently, all MPC protocols require a majority assumption on the nodes running the protocol. While this is fine in practice, in theory it enables MPC nodes to collude and provide an incorrect result. Our current design relies of AWS Nitro Enclaves to ensures the MPC nodes run the correct software, but this makes verifiability dependent on hardware security, which is suboptimal. To address this, we are working on adding ZK proofs to the MPC protocols, allowing anyone to verify that the individual contributions of MPC nodes are correct.Large MPC committees: MPC doesn’t scale well: the more parties are involved, the slower it gets. As a result, most MPC protocols run with less than 10 nodes. While the Zama Protocol already uses more (13 nodes), it would be preferable to increase that number to a hundred, ensuring even more robustness and decentralization.Enabling anyone to be an operatorRunning MPC inside HSMs: a major issue with MPC protocols is the need to trust the nodes with not leaking their share of the private key. This is typically done by using TEEs and a trusted committee of nodes. However this does not enable permissionless participation, as malicious attackers could try to break the TEE and access the secret in it. As an alternative, we are exploring how to run MPC inside HSMs such as those used by banks and other critical infrastructure.ZK-FHE: by proving the correctness of the FHE computation, it becomes possible to replace the Coprocessor consensus by a Proof-of-Work style protocol where anyone can compete to execute FHE operations, as long as they provide a proof that the result is correct. Right now, the overhead of ZK on top of the overhead of FHE makes this impractical, but our team is making good progress.Making the protocol fully post-quantumPost-quantum ZKPoK: Zama’s FHE and MPC technologies are already resistant to quantum computers. However, the ZKPoK is not (similar to most ZK-SNARKs). We are working on replacing it with a lattice-based ZK scheme that is post-quantum.Post-quantum signatures: while we can make the Zama Protocol components post-quantum, signature schemes used by Host Chains are not currently post-quantum. We unfortunately do not have control over this, as it is up to the Ethereum, Solana and other L1/L2s communities to migrate to post-quantum signatures.Operations and governanceThe Zama Protocol uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake, with 16 operators running the protocol: initially 13 KMS nodes and 3 FHE Coprocessors (then more over time). They are chosen according to the following rules:genesis operators are selected based on reputation, DevOps experience and offchain value (equity, revenue, market cap, …). This enables bootstrapping security via reputation, as an operator with a large business value will likely lose customers if they get caught misbehaving in the Zama Protocol.we will progressively allow anyone to become a KMS or Coprocessor operator. To do so, they will first need to demonstrate they can reliably run a node in testnet, then stake at least 0.5% of the circulating $ZAMA supply. Every epoch (initially 3 months), the top 13 KMS and top 3 Coprocessor operators by stake are selected to run the protocol for the next epoch.the 16 active operators earn staking rewards in $ZAMA tokens, based on their role and stake.We are currently looking for the genesis operators! If you would like to apply just fill the form here.Token holders with limited infrastructure capabilities that would not qualify to be an operator can still participate in securing the protocol and earning rewards by delegating their $ZAMA tokens to the whitelisted operators. It is up to each operator to decide how to incentivize their delegators, whether through lower commissions or additional non-$ZAMA rewards.Updates to the Zama Protocol have to be adopted by a majority of operators to be effective. This includes software updates, changes to the fees, adding support for a new Host Chain, etc. The only exception is pausing the protocol in case of an emergency and blacklisting spammers, which any operator can do (however unpausing / de-blacklisting requires going through the normal social consensus flow). In case of abuse, operators can get slashed. This ensures that the Zama Protocol has a swift mechanism to address critical issues, while incentivizing operators to behave honestly.Finally, onchain voting by $ZAMA tokens holders is used for 1. changes to the inflation rate and 2. slashing misbehaving operators.The $ZAMA tokenThe $ZAMA token is the native token of the Zama Protocol. It is used for protocol fees, staking and governance. It follows a burn and mint model, where 100% of the fees are burnt and tokens are minted to reward operators.Fee modelDeploying a confidential app on a supported chain is free and permissionless. Furthermore, the Zama Protocol does not charge for the FHE computation, instead charging for:Verifying ZKPoKs. Each time a user includes encrypted inputs in a transaction, they need to pay a fee to the Zama Protocol to verify it. The fee depends on the number of bits to be verified.Decrypting ciphertexts. When a user wants to decrypt a ciphertext, they need to pay a fee to the Zama Protocol. The fee depends on the number of bits to be decrypted.Bridging ciphertexts. When a user wants to bridge an encrypted value from one chain to another, it needs to request it from the Zama Protocol and pay a fee based on the number of bits bridged.The protocol fees can be paid by the end user, the frontend app or a relayer. As such, developers can create applications without their users ever needing to hold $ZAMA tokens directly.Protocol fees are paid with $ZAMA tokens, but are priced in USD. A price oracle regularly updates the $ZAMA/USD price on the Gateway, which updates the number of $ZAMA tokens paid for each protocol functionality. This has several advantages:it ensures protocol fees are proportional to usage and not dependent on speculationit creates predictability for users, developers and relayers, which can model their costs in USD rather than potentially volatile tokens.Additionally, the Zama Protocol uses a volume-based fee model: the more someone uses the protocol, the less fees they pay per operation. The smart contracts on the Gateway keep track of the number of bits each address has verified/decrypted/bridged over the last 30 days, and applies a discount based on volume. Discounts range from 10% to 99% depending on volume.The initial fee structure is as follows. It can be changed via social consensus based on network performance, operating costs or other reasons put forward by token holders:ZKPoK verification: $0.016 to $0.0002 per bitBridging: $0.016 to $0.0002 per bitDecryption: $0.0016 to $0.00002 per bitDecryption is priced at 1/10th of ZKPoKs and bridging, as they typically happen much more often (we expect a 10:1 ratio between decryptions and ZKPoK verification).Taking a confidential token transfer as an example:amounts and balances are 64 bitsthere is typically 3 decryptions per transaction, one for each of the sender and receiver balances, and one for the final amount transferred, which will be set to 0 if the transfer failed.as such, the total cost would be, depending on the discount:ZKPoK verification: 64 * ZPoK_bit_price = $0.01 to $1Decryption of 2 balances + amount: 64 * 3 * decryption_bit_price = $0.003 to $0.30Total cost: ~$0.01 to $1.3 on averageThis model is designed to be affordable for large users and profitable for operators, regardless of market condition and price volatility. For a small occasional user, it would cost around $1 per transaction, while for a large user (eg a wallet), it could cost as little as 1c per transaction.Fees are initially chosen such that each 1 tps on a host chain generates on average $3.5m in fees yearly on the Zama Protocol. As such, if 10% of global blockchain transactions use the Zama Protocol for confidentiality (about 300 tps), there could be up to $1b / year in fee revenues for the protocol.Staking rewardsOperators need to stake $ZAMA tokens to participate in running the protocol and receive the associated staking rewards. Tokens distributed as staking rewards are minted according to an inflation rate (10% initially), which can be changed via onchain governance.When rewards are distributed, they are first split by role (sequencer, coprocessors, KMS nodes), then distributed pro-rata of the stake of each operator within that group. Each operator then decides how they want to split their rewards with their delegators (we anticipate they will take ~20% commission).The table below summarizes the percentage of rewards going to each group, and the expected operator infra costs:Coprocessors13.3%3$20,000 / 10 tps on host chainsKMS4.6%13$2,500 / 50 tps decryptionsDistributing rewards this way ensures that each operator gets rewarded according to the job they did, while incentivizing delegators to carefully vet operators they delegate to.DistributionMore information coming soon—Follow Zama on X to get latest updates.About Zama, the companyThe Zama Protocol is a spinout from Zama, an open source cryptography company building state-of-the-art Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) solutions for blockchain and AI.Zama has raised over $150m at a $1b valuation from some of the most successful blockchain investors, including Multicoin, Pantera, Blockchange and Protocol Labs, as well as founders of major protocols such as Juan Benet (IPFS/Filecoin), Gavin Wood (Ethereum/Polkadot), Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana), Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), and others.TeamZama is a cryptography company operating across the globe.

# Configuration | Protocol

Configuration | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageConfigurationThis document explains how to enable encrypted computations in your smart contract by setting up the fhevm environment. Learn how to integrate essential libraries, configure encryption, and add secure computation logic to your contracts.Core configuration setupTo utilize encrypted computations in Solidity contracts, you must configure the FHE library and Oracle addresses. The fhevm package simplifies this process with prebuilt configuration contracts, allowing you to focus on developing your contract’s logic without handling the underlying cryptographic setup.This library and its associated contracts provide a standardized way to configure and interact with Zama's FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) infrastructure on different Ethereum networks. It supplies the necessary contract addresses for Zama's FHEVM components (ACL, FHEVMExecutor, KMSVerifier, InputVerifier) and the decryption oracle, enabling seamless integration for Solidity contracts that require FHEVM support.Key components configured automaticallyFHE library: Sets up encryption parameters and cryptographic keys.Oracle: Manages secure cryptographic operations such as public decryption.Network-specific settings: Adapts to local testing, testnets (Sepolia for example), or mainnet deployment.By inheriting these configuration contracts, you ensure seamless initialization and functionality across environments.ZamaConfig.solThe ZamaConfig library exposes functions to retrieve FHEVM configuration structs and oracle addresses for supported networks (currently only the Sepolia testnet).Under the hood, this library encapsulates the network-specific addresses of Zama's FHEVM infrastructure into a single struct (FHEVMConfigStruct).SepoliaConfigThe SepoliaConfig contract is designed to be inherited by a user contract. The constructor automatically sets up the FHEVM coprocessor and decryption oracle using the configuration provided by the library for the respective network. When a contract inherits from SepoliaConfig, the constructor calls FHE.setCoprocessor and FHE.setDecryptionOracle with the appropriate addresses. This ensures that the inheriting contract is automatically wired to the correct FHEVM contracts and oracle for the target network, abstracting away manual address management and reducing the risk of misconfiguration.Example: using Sepolia configurationpragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract MyERC20 is SepoliaConfig {
constructor() {
// Additional initialization logic if needed
}
}Using isInitializedThe isInitialized utility function checks whether an encrypted variable has been properly initialized, preventing unexpected behavior due to uninitialized values.Function signaturePurposeEnsures encrypted variables are initialized before use.Prevents potential logic errors in contract execution.Example: Initialization Check for Encrypted CounterSummaryBy leveraging prebuilt a configuration contract like SepoliaConfig in ZamaConfig.sol, you can efficiently set up your smart contract for encrypted computations. These tools abstract the complexity of cryptographic initialization, allowing you to focus on building secure, confidential smart contracts.Previous4.

# Access Control List | Protocol

Access Control List | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListThis document describes the Access Control List (ACL) system in FHEVM, a core feature that governs access to encrypted data. The ACL ensures that only authorized accounts or contracts can interact with specific ciphertexts, preserving confidentiality while enabling composable smart contracts. This overview provides a high-level understanding of what the ACL is, why it's essential, and how it works.What is the ACL?The ACL is a permission management system designed to control who can access, compute on, or decrypt encrypted values in fhevm. By defining and enforcing these permissions, the ACL ensures that encrypted data remains secure while still being usable within authorized contexts.Why is the ACL important?Encrypted data in FHEVM is entirely confidential, meaning that without proper access control, even the contract holding the ciphertext cannot interact with it. The ACL enables:Granular permissions: Define specific access rules for individual accounts or contracts.Secure computations: Ensure that only authorized entities can manipulate or decrypt encrypted data.Gas efficiency: Optimize permissions using transient access for temporary needs, reducing storage and gas costs.How does the ACL work?Types of accessPermanent allowance:Configured using FHE.allow(ciphertext, address).Grants long-term access to the ciphertext for a specific address.Stored in a dedicated contract for persistent storage.Transient allowance:Configured using FHE.allowTransient(ciphertext, address).Grants access to the ciphertext only for the duration of the current transaction.Stored in transient storage, reducing gas costs.Ideal for temporary operations like passing ciphertexts to external functions.Permanent public allowance:Configured using FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext).Grants long-term access to the ciphertext for any user.Stored in a dedicated contract for persistent storage.Syntactic sugar:FHE.allowThis(ciphertext) is shorthand for FHE.allow(ciphertext, address(this)). It authorizes the current contract to reuse a ciphertext handle in future transactions.Transient vs. permanent allowanceTransientTemporary access during a transaction.Transient storage (EIP-1153)Calling external functions or computations with ciphertexts. Use when wanting to save on gas costs.PermanentLong-term access across multiple transactions.Dedicated contract storagePersistent ciphertexts for contracts or users requiring ongoing access.Granting and verifying accessGranting accessDevelopers can use functions like allow, allowThis, and allowTransient to grant permissions:allow: Grants permanent access to an address.allowThis: Grants the current contract access to manipulate the ciphertext.allowTransient: Grants temporary access to an address for the current transaction.Verifying accessTo check if an entity has permission to access a ciphertext, use functions like isAllowed or isSenderAllowed:isAllowed: Verifies if a specific address has permission.isSenderAllowed: Simplifies checks for the current transaction sender.Practical uses of the ACLConfidential parameters: Pass encrypted values securely between contracts, ensuring only authorized entities can access them.Secure state management: Store encrypted state variables while controlling who can modify or read them.Privacy-preserving computations: Enable computations on encrypted data with confidence that permissions are enforced.For a detailed explanation of the ACL's functionality, including code examples and advanced configurations, see ACL examples.PreviousEncrypted inputsNextACL examplesLast updated 11 days ago

# Encrypted inputs | Protocol

Encrypted inputs | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageEncrypted inputsThis document introduces the concept of encrypted inputs in the FHEVM, explaining their role, structure, validation process, and how developers can integrate them into smart contracts and applications.Encrypted inputs are a core feature of FHEVM, enabling users to push encrypted data onto the blockchain while ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.What are encrypted inputs?Encrypted inputs are data values submitted by users in ciphertext form. These inputs allow sensitive information to remain confidential while still being processed by smart contracts. They are accompanied by Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPoKs) to ensure the validity of the encrypted data without revealing the plaintext.Key characteristics of encrypted inputs:Confidentiality: Data is encrypted using the public FHE key, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt or process the values.Validation via ZKPoKs: Each encrypted input is accompanied by a proof verifying that the user knows the plaintext value of the ciphertext, preventing replay attacks or misuse.Efficient packing: All inputs for a transaction are packed into a single ciphertext in a user-defined order, optimizing the size and generation of the zero-knowledge proof.Parameters in encrypted functionsWhen a function in a smart contract is called, it may accept two types of parameters for encrypted inputs:externalEbool, externalEaddress,externalEuintXX: Refers to the index of the encrypted parameter within the proof, representing a specific encrypted input handle.bytes: Contains the ciphertext and the associated zero-knowledge proof used for validation.Here’s an example of a Solidity function accepting multiple encrypted parameters: exampleFunction(
externalEbool param1,
externalEuint64 param2,
externalEuint8 param3,
bytes calldata inputProof
) public {
// Function logic here
}In this example, param1, param2, and param3 are encrypted inputs for ebool, euint64, and euint8 while inputProof contains the corresponding ZKPoK to validate their authenticity.Input Generation using HardhatIn the below example, we use Alice's address to create the encrypted inputs and submits the transaction.
const input = fhevm.createEncryptedInput(contract.address, signers.alice.address);
input.addBool(canTransfer); // at index 0
input.add64(transferAmount); // at index 1
input.add8(transferType); // at index 2
const encryptedInput = await input.encrypt();
const externalEboolParam1 = encryptedInput.handles[0];
const externalEuint64Param2 = encryptedInput.handles[1];
const externalEuint8Param3 = encryptedInput.handles[2];
const inputProof = encryptedInput.inputProof;
tx = await myContract
.connect(signers.alice)
[
"exampleFunction(bytes32,bytes32,bytes32,bytes)"
](signers.bob.address, externalEboolParam1, externalEuint64Param2, externalEuint8Param3, inputProof);
await tx.wait();Input OrderDevelopers are free to design the function parameters in any order. There is no required correspondence between the order in which encrypted inputs are constructed in TypeScript and the order of arguments in the Solidity function.Validating encrypted inputsSmart contracts process encrypted inputs by verifying them against the associated zero-knowledge proof. This is done using the FHE.asEuintXX, FHE.asEbool, or FHE.asEaddress functions, which validate the input and convert it into the appropriate encrypted type.Example validationThis example demonstrates a function that performs multiple encrypted operations, such as updating a user's encrypted balance and toggling an encrypted boolean flag: // Validate and convert the encrypted inputs
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
ebool toggleFlag = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedToggle, inputProof);
// Update the user's encrypted balance
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], amount);
// Toggle the user's encrypted flag
userFlags[msg.sender] = FHE.not(toggleFlag);
// FHE permissions and function logic here
...
}
// Function to retrieve a user's encrypted balance
function getEncryptedBalance() public view returns (euint64) {
return balances[msg.sender];
}
// Function to retrieve a user's encrypted flag
function getEncryptedFlag() public view returns (ebool) {
return userFlags[msg.sender];
}Example validation in the ConfidentialERC20.sol smart contractHere’s an example of a smart contract function that verifies an encrypted input before proceeding: address to,
externalEuint64 encryptedAmount,
bytes calldata inputProof
) public {
// Verify the provided encrypted amount and convert it into an encrypted uint64
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
// Function logic here, such as transferring funds
...
}How validation worksInput verification:
The FHE.fromExternal function ensures that the input is a valid ciphertext with a corresponding ZKPoK.Type conversion:
The function transforms externalEbool, externalEaddress, externalEuintXX into the appropriate encrypted type (ebool, eaddress, euintXX) for further operations within the contract.Best PracticesInput packing: Minimize the size and complexity of zero-knowledge proofs by packing all encrypted inputs into a single ciphertext.Frontend encryption: Always encrypt inputs using the FHE public key on the client side to ensure data confidentiality.Proof management: Ensure that the correct zero-knowledge proof is associated with each encrypted input to avoid validation errors.Encrypted inputs and their validation form the backbone of secure and private interactions in the FHEVM. By leveraging these tools, developers can create robust, privacy-preserving smart contracts without compromising functionality or scalability.PreviousGenerate random numbersNextAccess Control ListLast updated 11 days ago

# Operations on encrypted types | Protocol

Operations on encrypted types | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesThis document outlines the operations supported on encrypted types in the FHE library, enabling arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, and more on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) ciphertexts.Arithmetic operationsThe following arithmetic operations are supported for encrypted integers (euintX):AddFHE.add+BinarySubtractFHE.sub-BinaryMultiplyFHE.mul*BinaryDivide (plaintext divisor)FHE.divBinaryReminder (plaintext divisor)FHE.remBinaryNegationFHE.neg-UnaryMinFHE.minBinaryMaxFHE.maxBinaryDivision (FHE.div) and remainder (FHE.rem) operations are currently supported only with plaintext divisors.Bitwise operationsThe FHE library also supports bitwise operations, including shifts and rotations:Bitwise ANDFHE.and&BinaryBitwise ORFHE.or|BinaryBitwise XORFHE.xor^BinaryBitwise NOTFHE.not~UnaryShift RightFHE.shrBinaryShift LeftFHE.shlBinaryRotate RightFHE.rotrBinaryRotate LeftFHE.rotlBinaryThe shift operators FHE.shr and FHE.shl can take any encrypted type euintX as a first operand and either a uint8or a euint8 as a second operand, however the second operand will always be computed modulo the number of bits of the first operand. For example, FHE.shr(euint64 x, 70) is equivalent to FHE.shr(euint64 x, 6) because 70 % 64 = 6. This differs from the classical shift operators in Solidity, where there is no intermediate modulo operation, so for instance any uint64 shifted right via >> would give a null result.Comparison operationsEncrypted integers can be compared using the following functions:EqualFHE.eqBinaryNot equalFHE.neBinaryGreater than or equalFHE.geBinaryGreater thanFHE.gtBinaryLess than or equalFHE.leBinaryLess thanFHE.ltBinaryTernary operationThe FHE.select function is a ternary operation that selects one of two encrypted values based on an encrypted condition:SelectFHE.selectTernaryRandom operationsYou can generate cryptographically secure random numbers fully on-chain:NameFunction NameSymbolTypeRandom Unsigned IntegerFHE.randEuintX()RandomFor more details, refer to the Random Encrypted Numbers document.Best PracticesHere are some best practices to follow when using encrypted operations in your smart contracts:Use the appropriate encrypted type sizeChoose the smallest encrypted type that can accommodate your data to optimize gas costs. For example, use euint8 for small numbers (0-255) rather than euint256.❌ Avoid using oversized types:euint64 age = FHE.asEuint128(25); // age will never exceed 255
euint64 percentage = FHE.asEuint128(75); // percentage is 0-100✅ Instead, use the smallest appropriate type:euint8 age = FHE.asEuint8(25); // age fits in 8 bits
euint8 percentage = FHE.asEuint8(75); // percentage fits in 8 bitsUse scalar operands when possible to save gasSome FHE operators exist in two versions: one where all operands are ciphertexts handles, and another where one of the operands is an unencrypted scalar. Whenever possible, use the scalar operand version, as this will save a lot of gas.❌ For example, this snippet cost way more in gas:...
x = FHE.add(x,FHE.asEuint(42));✅ Than this one:// ...
x = FHE.add(x,42);Despite both leading to the same encrypted result!Beware of overflows of FHE arithmetic operatorsFHE arithmetic operators can overflow. Do not forget to take into account such a possibility when implementing FHEVM smart contracts.❌ For example, if you wanted to create a mint function for an encrypted ERC20 token with an encrypted totalSupply state variable, this code is vulnerable to overflows: euint32 mintedAmount = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
totalSupply = FHE.add(totalSupply, mintedAmount);
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], mintedAmount);
FHE.allowThis(balances[msg.sender]);
FHE.allow(balances[msg.sender], msg.sender);
}✅ But you can fix this issue by using FHE.select to cancel the mint in case of an overflow: euint32 mintedAmount = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
euint32 tempTotalSupply = FHE.add(totalSupply, mintedAmount);
ebool isOverflow = FHE.lt(tempTotalSupply, totalSupply);
totalSupply = FHE.select(isOverflow, totalSupply, tempTotalSupply);
euint32 tempBalanceOf = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], mintedAmount);
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.select(isOverflow, balances[msg.sender], tempBalanceOf);
FHE.allowThis(balances[msg.sender]);
FHE.allow(balances[msg.sender], msg.sender);
}Notice that we did not check separately the overflow on balances[msg.sender] but only on totalSupply variable, because totalSupply is the sum of the balances of all the users, so balances[msg.sender] could never overflow if totalSupply did not.PreviousSupported typesNextCasting and trivial encryptionLast updated 11 days ago

# Decryption | Protocol

Decryption | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageDecryptionThis section explains how to handle decryption in fhevm. Decryption allows plaintext data to be accessed when required for contract logic or user presentation, ensuring confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.Decryption is essential in two primary cases:Smart contract logic: A contract requires plaintext values for computations or decision-making.User interaction: Plaintext data needs to be revealed to all users, such as revealing the decision of the vote.OverviewDecryption in FHEVM is an asynchronous process that involves the Relayer and Key Management System (KMS). Here’s an example of how to safely request decryption in a contract.Example: asynchronous decryption in a contract solidity ^0.8.24;
import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract TestAsyncDecrypt is SepoliaConfig {
ebool xBool;
bool public yBool;
bool isDecryptionPending;
uint256 latestRequestId;
constructor() {
xBool = FHE.asEbool(true);
FHE.allowThis(xBool);
}
function requestBool() public {
require(!isDecryptionPending, "Decryption is in progress");
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](1);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(xBool);
uint256 latestRequestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.myCustomCallback.selector);
/// @dev This prevents sending multiple requests before the first callback was sent.
isDecryptionPending = true;
}
function myCustomCallback(uint256 requestId, bytes memory cleartexts, bytes memory decryptionProof) public returns (bool) {
/// @dev This check is used to verify that the request id is the expected one.
require(requestId == latestRequestId, "Invalid requestId");
FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, cleartexts, decryptionProof);
(bool decryptedInput) = abi.decode(cleartexts, (bool));
yBool = decryptedInput;
isDecryptionPending = false;
return yBool;
}
}Decryption in depthThis document provides a detailed guide on implementing decryption in your smart contracts using the DecryptionOracle in fhevm. It covers the setup, usage of the FHE.requestDecryption function, and testing with Hardhat.DecryptionOracle setupThe DecryptionOracle is pre-deployed on the FHEVM testnet. It uses a default relayer account specified in the .env file.Anyone can fulfill decryption requests but it is essential to add signature verification (and to include a logic to invalidate the replay of decryption requests). The role of the DecryptionOracle contract is to independently verify the KMS signature during execution. This ensures that the relayers cannot manipulate or send fraudulent decryption results, even if compromised.There are two functions to consider: requestDecryption and checkSignatures.FHE.requestDecryption functionYou can call the function FHE.requestDecryption as such: bytes32[] calldata ctsHandles,
bytes4 callbackSelector
) external payable returns (uint256 requestId);Function argumentsThe first argument, ctsHandles, should be an array of ciphertexts handles which could be of different types, i.e uint256 values coming from unwrapping handles of type either ebool, euint8, euint16, euint32, euint64 or eaddress.ctsHandles is the array of ciphertexts that are requested to be decrypted. The relayer will send the corresponding ciphertexts to the KMS for decryption before fulfilling the request.callbackSelector is the function selector of the callback function, which will be called once the relayer fulfils the decryption request.cleartexts is the bytes array corresponding to the ABI encoding of all requested decrypted values. Each of these decrypted values' type should be a native Solidity type corresponding to the original ciphertext type, following this table of conventions:eboolbooleuint8uint8euint16uint16euint32uint32euint64uint64euint128uint128euint256uint256eaddressaddressHere callbackName is a custom name given by the developer to the callback function, requestID will be the request id of the decryption (could be commented if not needed in the logic, but must be present) and cleartexts is an ABI encoded byte array of the results of the decryption of the ct array values, i.e their number should be the size of the ct array. decryptionProof is a byte array containing the KMS signatures and extra data.msgValue is the value in native tokens to be sent to the calling contract during fulfillment, i.e when the callback will be called with the results of decryption.Notice that the callback should always verify the signatures and implement a replay protection mechanism (see below).FHE.checkSignatures functionYou can call the function FHE.checkSignatures as such:Function argumentsrequestID, is the value that was returned in the requestDecryption function.cleartexts, is an ABI encoding of the decrypted values associated to the handles (using abi.encode). This can contain one or multiple values, depending on the number of handles requested in the requestDecryption function. Each of these values' type must match the type of the corresponding handle.decryptionProof, is a byte array containing the KMS signatures and extra data.This function reverts if the signatures are invalid.PreviousError handlingNextHardhat pluginLast updated 11 days ago

Supported types | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageSupported typesThis document introduces the encrypted integer types provided by the FHE library in FHEVM and explains their usage, including casting, state variable declarations, and type-specific considerations.IntroductionThe FHE library offers a robust type system with encrypted integer types, enabling secure computations on confidential data in smart contracts. These encrypted types are validated both at compile time and runtime to ensure correctness and security.Key features of encrypted typesEncrypted integers function similarly to Solidity’s native integer types, but they operate on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) ciphertexts.Arithmetic operations on e(u)int types are unchecked, meaning they wrap around on overflow. This design choice ensures confidentiality by avoiding the leakage of information through error detection.Future versions of the FHE library will support encrypted integers with overflow checking, but with the trade-off of exposing limited information about the operands.Encrypted integers with overflow checking will soon be available in the FHE library. These will allow reversible arithmetic operations but may reveal some information about the input values.Encrypted integers in FHEVM are represented as FHE ciphertexts, abstracted using ciphertext handles. These types, prefixed with e (for example, euint64) act as secure wrappers over the ciphertext handles.List of encrypted typesThe FHE library currently supports the following encrypted types:Ebool2and, or, xor, eq, ne, not, select, randEuint88add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint1616add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint3232add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint6464add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint128128add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint160160Eaddress (eq, ne, select)Euint256256and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedDivision (div) and remainder (rem) operations are only supported when the right-hand side (rhs) operand is a plaintext (non-encrypted) value. Attempting to use an encrypted value as rhs will result in a panic. This restriction ensures correct and secure computation within the current framework.Higher-precision integer types are available in the TFHE-rs library and can be added to fhevm as needed.PreviousContract addressesNextOperations on encrypted typesLast updated 11 days ago

# Casting and trivial encryption | Protocol

Casting and trivial encryption | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesCasting and trivial encryptionThis documentation covers the asEbool, asEuintXX, and asEaddress operations provided by the FHE library for working with encrypted data in the FHEVM. These operations are essential for converting between plaintext and encrypted types, as well as handling encrypted inputs.The operations can be categorized into two main use cases:Trivial encryption: Converting plaintext values to encrypted typesType casting: Converting between different encrypted types1. Trivial encryptionTrivial encryption simply put is a plain text in a format of a ciphertext.OverviewTrivial encryption is the process of converting plaintext values into encrypted types (ciphertexts) compatible with FHE operators. Although the data is in ciphertext format, it remains publicly visible on-chain, making it useful for operations between public and private values.This type of casting involves converting plaintext (unencrypted) values into their encrypted equivalents, such as:bool → ebooluint → euintXXaddress → eaddressWhen doing trivial encryption, the data is made compatible with FHE operations but remains publicly visible on-chain unless explicitly encrypted.Example= FHE.asEuint64(7262); // Trivial encrypt a uint64
ebool valueBool = FHE.asEbool(true); // Trivial encrypt a boolean2. Casting between encrypted typesThis type of casting is used to reinterpret or convert one encrypted type into another. For example:euint32 → euint64Casting between encrypted types is often required when working with operations that demand specific sizes or precisions.Important: When casting between encrypted types:Casting from smaller types to larger types (e.g. euint32 → euint64) preserves all informationCasting from larger types to smaller types (e.g. euint64 → euint32) will truncate and lose informationThe table below summarizes the available casting functions:euintXeuintXFHE.asEuintXXebooleuintXFHE.asEuintXXeuintXeboolFHE.asEboolXXCasting between encrypted types is efficient and often necessary when handling data with differing precision requirements.Workflow for encrypted typeseuint32 value32 = FHE.asEuint32(value64); // Cast to euint32

# Generate random numbers | Protocol

Generate random numbers | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesGenerate random numbersThis document explains how to generate cryptographically secure random encrypted numbers fully on-chain using the FHE library in fhevm. These numbers are encrypted and remain confidential, enabling privacy-preserving smart contract logic.Key notes on random number generationOn-chain execution: Random number generation must be executed during a transaction, as it requires the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state to be updated on-chain. This operation cannot be performed using the eth_call RPC method.Cryptographic security: The generated random numbers are cryptographically secure and encrypted, ensuring privacy and unpredictability.Random number generation must be performed during transactions, as it requires the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state to be mutated on-chain. Therefore, it cannot be executed using the eth_call RPC method.Basic usageThe FHE library allows you to generate random encrypted numbers of various bit sizes. Below is a list of supported types and their usage:
ebool rb = FHE.randEbool(); // Random encrypted boolean
euint8 r8 = FHE.randEuint8(); // Random 8-bit number
euint16 r16 = FHE.randEuint16(); // Random 16-bit number
euint32 r32 = FHE.randEuint32(); // Random 32-bit number
euint64 r64 = FHE.randEuint64(); // Random 64-bit number
euint128 r128 = FHE.randEuint128(); // Random 128-bit number
euint256 r256 = FHE.randEuint256(); // Random 256-bit numberExample: Random Boolean return FHE.randEbool();
}Bounded random numbersTo generate random numbers within a specific range, you can specify an upper bound. The specified upper bound must be a power of 2. The random number will be in the range [0, upperBound - 1].euint8 r8 = FHE.randEuint8(32); // Random number between 0-31
euint16 r16 = FHE.randEuint16(512); // Random number between 0-511
euint32 r32 = FHE.randEuint32(65536); // Random number between 0-65535Example: Random number with upper bound return FHE.randEuint16(upperBound);
}Security ConsiderationsCryptographic security:
The random numbers are generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) and remain encrypted until explicitly decrypted.Gas consumption:
Each call to a random number generation function consumes gas. Developers should optimize the use of these functions, especially in gas-sensitive contracts.Privacy guarantee:
Random values are fully encrypted, ensuring they cannot be accessed or predicted by unauthorized parties.PreviousCasting and trivial encryptionNextEncrypted inputsLast updated 11 days ago

# Branching | Protocol

Branching | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsBranchingThis document explains how to implement conditional logic (if/else branching) when working with encrypted values in FHEVM. Unlike typical Solidity programming, working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) requires specialized methods to handle conditions on encrypted data.This document covers encrypted branching and how to move from an encrypted condition to a non-encrypted business logic in your smart contract.What is confidential branching?In FHEVM, when you perform comparison operations, the result is an encrypted boolean (ebool). Since encrypted booleans do not support standard boolean operations like if statements or logical operators, conditional logic must be implemented using specialized methods.To facilitate conditional assignments, FHEVM provides the FHE.select function, which acts as a ternary operator for encrypted values.Using FHE.select for conditional logicThe FHE.select function enables branching logic by selecting one of two encrypted values based on an encrypted condition (ebool). It works as follows:select(condition, valueIfTrue, valueIfFalse);condition: An encrypted boolean (ebool) resulting from a comparison.valueIfTrue: The encrypted value to return if the condition is true.valueIfFalse: The encrypted value to return if the condition is false.Example: Auction Bidding LogicHere's an example of using conditional logic to update the highest winning number in a guessing game: bid(externalEuint64 encryptedValue, bytes calldata inputProof) external onlyBeforeEnd {
// Convert the encrypted input to an encrypted 64-bit integer
euint64 bid = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedValue, inputProof);
// Compare the current highest bid with the new bid
ebool isAbove = FHE.lt(highestBid, bid);
// Update the highest bid if the new bid is greater
highestBid = FHE.select(isAbove, bid, highestBid);
// Allow the contract to use the updated highest bid ciphertext
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
}This is a simplified example to demonstrate the functionality.How Does It Work?Comparison:The FHE.lt function compares highestBid and bid, returning an ebool (isAbove) that indicates whether the new bid is higher.Selection:The FHE.select function updates highestBid to either the new bid or the previous highest bid, based on the encrypted condition isAbove.Permission Handling:After updating highestBid, the contract reauthorizes itself to manipulate the updated ciphertext using FHE.allowThis.Key ConsiderationsValue change behavior: Each time FHE.select assigns a value, a new ciphertext is created, even if the underlying plaintext value remains unchanged. This behavior is inherent to FHE and ensures data confidentiality, but developers should account for it when designing their smart contracts.Gas consumption: Using FHE.select and other encrypted operations incurs additional gas costs compared to traditional Solidity logic. Optimize your code to minimize unnecessary operations.Access control: Always use appropriate ACL functions (e.g., FHE.allowThis, FHE.allow) to ensure the updated ciphertexts are authorized for use in future computations or transactions.How to branch to a non-confidential path?So far, this section only covered how to do branching using encrypted variables. However, there may be many cases where the "public" contract logic will depend on the outcome from a encrypted path.To do so, there are only one way to branch from an encrypted path to a non-encrypted path: it requires a public decryption using the oracle. Hence, any contract logic that requires moving from an encrypted input to a non-encrypted path always requires an async contract logic.Example: Auction Bidding Logic: Item ReleaseGoing back to our previous example with the auction bidding logic. Let's assume that the winner of the auction can receive some prize, which is not confidential.eaddress internal highestBidder;
euint64 internal highestBid;
function bid(externalEuint64 encryptedValue, bytes calldata inputProof) external onlyBeforeEnd {
// Convert the encrypted input to an encrypted 64-bit integer
euint64 bid = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedValue, inputProof);
// Compare the current highest bid with the new bid
ebool isAbove = FHE.lt(highestBid, bid);
// Update the highest bid if the new bid is greater
highestBid = FHE.select(isAbove, bid, highestBid);
// Update the highest bidder address if the new bid is greater
highestBidder = FHE.select(isAbove, FHE.asEaddress(msg.sender), currentBidder));
// Allow the contract to use the highest bidder address
FHE.allowThis(highestBidder);
// Allow the contract to use the updated highest bid ciphertext
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
}
function revealWinner() external onlyAfterEnd {
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](2);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(highestBidder);
uint256 requestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.transferPrize.selector);
}
function transferPrize(uint256 requestId, address auctionWinner, bytes memory signatures) external {
require(!isPrizeDistributed, "Prize has already been distributed");
FHE.verifySignatures(requestId, signatures)
isPrizeDistributed = true;
// Business logic to transfer the prize to the auction winner
}This is a simplified example to demonstrate the functionality.As you can see the in the above example, the path to move from an encrypted condition to a decrypted business logic must be async and requires calling the decryption oracle contract to reveal the result of the logic using encrypted variables.SummaryFHE.select is a powerful tool for conditional logic on encrypted values.Encrypted booleans (ebool) and values maintain confidentiality, enabling privacy-preserving logic.Developers should account for gas costs and ciphertext behavior when designing conditional operations.PreviousLogicsNextDealing with branches and conditionsLast updated 11 days ago

# Error handling | Protocol

Error handling | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsError handlingThis document explains how to handle errors effectively in FHEVM smart contracts. Since transactions involving encrypted data do not automatically revert when conditions are not met, developers need alternative mechanisms to communicate errors to users.Challenges in error handlingIn the context of encrypted data:No automatic reversion: Transactions do not revert if a condition fails, making it challenging to notify users of issues like insufficient funds or invalid inputs.Limited feedback: Encrypted computations lack direct mechanisms for exposing failure reasons while maintaining confidentiality.Recommended approach: Error logging with a handlerTo address these challenges, implement an error handler that records the most recent error for each user. This allows dApps or frontends to query error states and provide appropriate feedback to users.Example implementationThe following contract snippet demonstrates how to implement and use an error handler: LastError {
euint8 error; // Encrypted error code
uint timestamp; // Timestamp of the error
}
// Define error codes
euint8 internal NO_ERROR;
euint8 internal NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS;
constructor() {
NO_ERROR = FHE.asEuint8(0); // Code 0: No error
NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS = FHE.asEuint8(1); // Code 1: Insufficient funds
}
// Store the last error for each address
mapping(address => LastError) private _lastErrors;
// Event to notify about an error state change
event ErrorChanged(address indexed user);
/**
* @dev Set the last error for a specific address.
* @param error Encrypted error code.
* @param addr Address of the user.
*/
function setLastError(euint8 error, address addr) private {
_lastErrors[addr] = LastError(error, block.timestamp);
emit ErrorChanged(addr);
}
/**
* @dev Internal transfer function with error handling.
* @param from Sender's address.
* @param to Recipient's address.
* @param amount Encrypted transfer amount.
*/
function _transfer(address from, address to, euint32 amount) internal {
// Check if the sender has enough balance to transfer
ebool canTransfer = FHE.le(amount, balances[from]);
// Log the error state: NO_ERROR or NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS
setLastError(FHE.select(canTransfer, NO_ERROR, NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS), msg.sender);
// Perform the transfer operation conditionally
balances[to] = FHE.add(balances[to], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint32(0)));
FHE.allowThis(balances[to]);
FHE.allow(balances[to], to);
balances[from] = FHE.sub(balances[from], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint32(0)));
FHE.allowThis(balances[from]);
FHE.allow(balances[from], from);
}How It WorksDefine error codes:NO_ERROR: Indicates a successful operation.NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS: Indicates insufficient balance for a transfer.Record errors:Use the setLastError function to log the latest error for a specific address along with the current timestamp.Emit the ErrorChanged event to notify external systems (e.g., dApps) about the error state change.Conditional updates:Use the FHE.select function to update balances and log errors based on the transfer condition (canTransfer).Frontend integration:The dApp can query _lastErrors for a user’s most recent error and display appropriate feedback, such as "Insufficient funds" or "Transaction successful."Example error queryThe frontend or another contract can query the _lastErrors mapping to retrieve error details: * @dev Get the last error for a specific address.
* @param user Address of the user.
* @return error Encrypted error code.
* @return timestamp Timestamp of the error.
*/
function getLastError(address user) public view returns (euint8 error, uint timestamp) {
LastError memory lastError = _lastErrors[user];
return (lastError.error, lastError.timestamp);
}Benefits of this approachUser feedback:Provides actionable error messages without compromising the confidentiality of encrypted computations.Scalable error tracking:Logs errors per user, making it easy to identify and debug specific issues.Event-driven notifications:Enables frontends to react to errors in real time via the ErrorChanged event.By implementing error handlers as demonstrated, developers can ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining the privacy and integrity of encrypted data operations.PreviousDealing with branches and conditionsNextDecryptionLast updated 11 days ago

# Dealing with branches and conditions | Protocol

Dealing with branches and conditions | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsDealing with branches and conditionsThis document explains how to handle branches, loops or conditions when working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically when the condition / index is encrypted.Breaking a loop❌ In FHE, it is not possible to break a loop based on an encrypted condition. For example, this would not work:= FHE.asEuint(6); // Could be a value between 0 and 10
euint8 x = FHE.asEuint(0);
// some code
while(FHE.lt(x, maxValue)){
x = FHE.add(x, 2);
}If your code logic requires looping on an encrypted boolean condition, we highly suggest to try to replace it by a finite loop with an appropriate constant maximum number of steps and use FHE.select inside the loop.Suggested approach✅ For example, the previous code could maybe be replaced by the following snippet:= FHE.asEuint(6); // Could be a value between 0 and 10
euint8 x;
// some code
for (uint32 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
euint8 toAdd = FHE.select(FHE.lt(x, maxValue), 2, 0);
x = FHE.add(x, toAdd);
}In this snippet, we perform 10 iterations, adding 4 to x in each iteration as long as the iteration count is less than maxValue. If the iteration count exceeds maxValue, we add 0 instead for the remaining iterations because we can't break the loop.Best practicesObfuscate branchingThe previous paragraph emphasized that branch logic should rely as much as possible on FHE.select instead of decryptions. It hides effectively which branch has been executed.However, this is sometimes not enough. Enhancing the privacy of smart contracts often requires revisiting your application's logic.For example, if implementing a simple AMM for two encrypted ERC20 tokens based on a linear constant function, it is recommended to not only hide the amounts being swapped, but also the token which is swapped in a pair.✅ Here is a very simplified example implementation, we suppose here that the rate between tokenA and tokenB is constant and equals to 1:// ideally, the user already owns some amounts of both tokens and has pre-approved the AMM on both tokens
function swapTokensForTokens(
externalEuint32 encryptedAmountAIn,
externalEuint32 encryptedAmountBIn,
bytes calldata inputProof
) external {
euint32 encryptedAmountA = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmountAIn, inputProof); // even if amount is null, do a transfer to obfuscate trade direction
euint32 encryptedAmountB = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmountBIn, inputProof); // even if amount is null, do a transfer to obfuscate trade direction
// send tokens from user to AMM contract
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountA, tokenA);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenA).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountA);
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountB, tokenB);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenB).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountB);
// send tokens from AMM contract to user
// Price of tokenA in tokenB is constant and equal to 1, so we just swap the encrypted amounts here
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountB, tokenA);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenA).transfer(msg.sender, encryptedAmountB);
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountA, tokenB);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenB).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountA);
}Notice that to preserve confidentiality, we had to make two inputs transfers on both tokens from the user to the AMM contract, and similarly two output transfers from the AMM to the user, even if technically most of the times it will make sense that one of the user inputs encryptedAmountAIn or encryptedAmountBIn is actually an encrypted zero.This is different from a classical non-confidential AMM with regular ERC20 tokens: in this case, the user would need to just do one input transfer to the AMM on the token being sold, and receive only one output transfer from the AMM on the token being bought.Avoid using encrypted indexesUsing encrypted indexes to pick an element from an array without revealing it is not very efficient, because you would still need to loop on all the indexes to preserve confidentiality.However, there are plans to make this kind of operation much more efficient in the future, by adding specialized operators for arrays.For instance, imagine you have an encrypted array called encArray and you want to update an encrypted value x to match an item from this list, encArray[i], without disclosing which item you're choosing.❌ You must loop over all the indexes and check equality homomorphically, however this pattern is very expensive in gas and should be avoided whenever possible.euint32[] encArray;
function setXwithEncryptedIndex(externalEuint32 encryptedIndex, bytes calldata inputProof) public {
euint32 index = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedIndex, inputProof);
for (uint32 i = 0; i < encArray.length; i++) {
ebool isEqual = FHE.eq(index, i);
x = FHE.select(isEqual, encArray[i], x);
}
FHE.allowThis(x);

# ACL examples | Protocol

ACL examples | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListACL examplesThis page provides detailed instructions and examples on how to use and implement the ACL (Access Control List) in FHEVM. For an overview of ACL concepts and their importance, refer to the access control list (ACL) overview.Controlling access: permanent and transient allowancesThe ACL system allows you to define two types of permissions for accessing ciphertexts:Permanent allowanceFunction: FHE.allow(ciphertext, address)Purpose: Grants persistent access to a ciphertext for a specific address.Storage: Permissions are saved in a dedicated ACL contract, making them available across transactions.Alternative Solidity syntaxYou can also use method-chaining syntax for granting allowances since FHE is a Solidity library. FHE for *;
ciphertext.allow(address1).allow(address2);This is equivalent to calling FHE.allow(ciphertext, address1) followed by FHE.allow(ciphertext, address2).Transient allowanceFunction: FHE.allowTransient(ciphertext, address)Purpose: Grants temporary access for the duration of a single transaction.Storage: Permissions are stored in transient storage to save gas costs.Use Case: Ideal for passing encrypted values between functions or contracts during a transaction.Alternative Solidity syntaxMethod chaining is also available for transient allowances since FHE is a Solidity library.ciphertext.allowTransient(address1).allowTransient(address2);Syntactic sugarFunction: FHE.allowThis(ciphertext)Equivalent To: FHE.allow(ciphertext, address(this))Purpose: Simplifies granting permanent access to the current contract for managing ciphertexts.Alternative Solidity syntaxYou can also use method-chaining syntax for allowThis since FHE is a Solidity library.ciphertext.allowThis();Make publicly decryptableTo make a ciphertext publicly decryptable, you can use the FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext) function. This grants decryption rights to anyone, which is useful for scenarios where the encrypted value should be accessible by all.FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext);
// Or using method syntax:
ciphertext.makePubliclyDecryptable();Function: FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext)Purpose: Makes the ciphertext decryptable by anyone.Use Case: When you want to publish encrypted results or data.You can combine multiple allowance methods (such as .allow(), .allowThis(), .allowTransient()) directly on ciphertext objects to grant access to several addresses or contracts in a single, fluent statement.Exampleciphertext.allowTransient(address1).allow(address2);
// Grant permanent access to the current contract and another address
ciphertext.allowThis().allow(address1);Best practicesVerifying sender accessWhen processing ciphertexts as input, it’s essential to validate that the sender is authorized to interact with the provided encrypted data. Failing to perform this verification can expose the system to inference attacks where malicious actors attempt to deduce private information.Example scenario: Confidential ERC20 attackConsider an Confidential ERC20 token. An attacker controlling two accounts, Account A and Account B, with 100 tokens in Account A, could exploit the system as follows:The attacker attempts to send the target user's encrypted balance from Account A to Account B.Observing the transaction outcome, the attacker gains information:If successful: The target's balance is equal to or less than 100 tokens.If failed: The target's balance exceeds 100 tokens.This type of attack allows the attacker to infer private balances without explicit access.To prevent this, always use the FHE.isSenderAllowed() function to verify that the sender has legitimate access to the encrypted amount being transferred.Example: secure verification // Ensure the sender is authorized to access the encrypted amount
require(FHE.isSenderAllowed(encryptedAmount), "Unauthorized access to encrypted amount.");
// Proceed with further logic
...
}By enforcing this check, you can safeguard against inference attacks and ensure that encrypted values are only manipulated by authorized entities.ACL for user decryptionIf a ciphertext can be decrypt by a user, explicit access must be granted to them. Additionally, the user decryption mechanism requires the signature of a public key associated with the contract address. Therefore, a value that needs to be decrypted must be explicitly authorized for both the user and the contract.Due to the user decryption mechanism, a user signs a public key associated with a specific contract; therefore, the ciphertext also needs to be allowed for the contract.Example: Secure Transfer in ConfidentialERC20 require(FHE.isSenderAllowed(encryptedAmount), "The caller is not authorized to access this encrypted amount.");
euint64 amount = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedAmount);
ebool canTransfer = FHE.le(amount, balances[msg.sender]);
euint64 newBalanceTo = FHE.add(balances[to], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint64(0)));
balances[to] = newBalanceTo;
// Allow this new balance for both the contract and the owner.
FHE.allowThis(newBalanceTo);

euint64 newBalanceFrom = FHE.sub(balances[from], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint64(0)));
balances[from] = newBalanceFrom;
// Allow this new balance for both the contract and the owner.
FHE.allowThis(newBalanceFrom);
FHE.allow(newBalanceFrom, from);

# Reorgs handling | Protocol

Reorgs handling | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListReorgs handlingThis page provides detailed instructions on how to handle reorg risks on Ethereum when using FHEVM.Since ACL events are propagated from the FHEVM host chain to the Gateway immediately after being included in a block, dApp developers must take special care when encrypted information is critically important. For example, if an encrypted handle conceals the private key of a Bitcoin wallet holding significant funds, we need to ensure that this information cannot inadvertently leak to the wrong person due to a reorg on the FHEVM host chain. Therefore, it's the responsibility of dApp developers to prevent such scenarios by implementing a two-step ACL authorization process with a timelock between the request and the ACL call.Simple example: Handling reorg risk on EthereumOn Ethereum, a reorg can be up to 95 slots deep in the worst case, so waiting for more than 95 blocks should ensure that a previously sent transaction has been finalized—unless more than 1/3 of the nodes are malicious and willing to lose their stake, which is highly improbable.❌ Instead of writing this contract: PrivateKeySale {
euint256 privateKey;
bool isAlreadyBought = false;
constructor(externalEuint256 _privateKey, bytes inputProof) {
privateKey = FHE.fromExternal(_privateKey, inputProof);
FHE.allowThis(privateKey);
}
function buyPrivateKey() external payable {
require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Must pay 1 ETH");
require(!isBought, "Private key already bought");
isBought = true;
FHE.allow(encryptedPrivateKey, msg.sender);
}
}Since the `privateKey`` encrypted variable contains critical information, we don't want to mistakenly leak it for free if a reorg occurs. This could happen in the previous example because we immediately grant authorization to the buyer in the same transaction that processes the sale.✅ We recommend writing something like this instead: euint256 privateKey;
bool isAlreadyBought = false;
uint256 blockWhenBought = 0;
address buyer;
constructor(externalEuint256 _privateKey, bytes inputProof) {
privateKey = FHE.fromExternal(_privateKey, inputProof);
FHE.allowThis(privateKey);
}
function buyPrivateKey() external payable {
require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Must pay 1 ETH");
require(!isBought, "Private key already bought");
isBought = true;
blockWhenBought = block.number;
buyer = msg.sender;
}
function requestACL() external {
require(isBought, "Private key has not been bought yet");
require(block.number > blockWhenBought + 95, "Too early to request ACL, risk of reorg");
FHE.allow(privateKey, buyer);
}
}This approach ensures that at least 96 blocks have elapsed between the transaction that purchases the private key and the transaction that authorizes the buyer to decrypt it.This type of contract worsens the user experience by adding a timelock before users can decrypt data, so it should be used sparingly: only when leaked information could be critically important and high-value.PreviousACL examplesNextLogicsLast updated 11 days ago

# Access Control List | Protocol

Access Control List | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListThis document describes the Access Control List (ACL) system in FHEVM, a core feature that governs access to encrypted data. The ACL ensures that only authorized accounts or contracts can interact with specific ciphertexts, preserving confidentiality while enabling composable smart contracts. This overview provides a high-level understanding of what the ACL is, why it's essential, and how it works.What is the ACL?The ACL is a permission management system designed to control who can access, compute on, or decrypt encrypted values in fhevm. By defining and enforcing these permissions, the ACL ensures that encrypted data remains secure while still being usable within authorized contexts.Why is the ACL important?Encrypted data in FHEVM is entirely confidential, meaning that without proper access control, even the contract holding the ciphertext cannot interact with it. The ACL enables:Granular permissions: Define specific access rules for individual accounts or contracts.Secure computations: Ensure that only authorized entities can manipulate or decrypt encrypted data.Gas efficiency: Optimize permissions using transient access for temporary needs, reducing storage and gas costs.How does the ACL work?Types of accessPermanent allowance:Configured using FHE.allow(ciphertext, address).Grants long-term access to the ciphertext for a specific address.Stored in a dedicated contract for persistent storage.Transient allowance:Configured using FHE.allowTransient(ciphertext, address).Grants access to the ciphertext only for the duration of the current transaction.Stored in transient storage, reducing gas costs.Ideal for temporary operations like passing ciphertexts to external functions.Permanent public allowance:Configured using FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext).Grants long-term access to the ciphertext for any user.Stored in a dedicated contract for persistent storage.Syntactic sugar:FHE.allowThis(ciphertext) is shorthand for FHE.allow(ciphertext, address(this)). It authorizes the current contract to reuse a ciphertext handle in future transactions.Transient vs. permanent allowanceTransientTemporary access during a transaction.Transient storage (EIP-1153)Calling external functions or computations with ciphertexts. Use when wanting to save on gas costs.PermanentLong-term access across multiple transactions.Dedicated contract storagePersistent ciphertexts for contracts or users requiring ongoing access.Granting and verifying accessGranting accessDevelopers can use functions like allow, allowThis, and allowTransient to grant permissions:allow: Grants permanent access to an address.allowThis: Grants the current contract access to manipulate the ciphertext.allowTransient: Grants temporary access to an address for the current transaction.Verifying accessTo check if an entity has permission to access a ciphertext, use functions like isAllowed or isSenderAllowed:isAllowed: Verifies if a specific address has permission.isSenderAllowed: Simplifies checks for the current transaction sender.Practical uses of the ACLConfidential parameters: Pass encrypted values securely between contracts, ensuring only authorized entities can access them.Secure state management: Store encrypted state variables while controlling who can modify or read them.Privacy-preserving computations: Enable computations on encrypted data with confidence that permissions are enforced.For a detailed explanation of the ACL's functionality, including code examples and advanced configurations, see ACL examples.PreviousEncrypted inputsNextACL examplesLast updated 3 months ago

# HCU | Protocol

HCU | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHCUThis guide explains how to use Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) operations in your smart contracts on FHEVM. Understanding HCU is critical for designing efficient confidential smart contracts.OverviewFHE operations in FHEVM are computationally intensive compared to standard Ethereum operations, as they require complex mathematical computations to maintain privacy and security. To manage computational load and prevent potential denial-of-service attacks, FHEVM implements a metering system called Homomorphic Complexity Units ("HCU").To represent this complexity, we introduced the Homomorphic Complexity Unit ("HCU"). In Solidity, each FHE operation consumes a set amount of HCU based on the operational computational complexity for hardware computation. Since FHE transactions are symbolic, this helps preventing resource exhaustion outside of the blockchain.To do so, there is a contract named HCULimit, which monitors HCU consumption for each transaction and enforces two key limits:Sequential homomorphic operations depth limit per transaction: Controls HCU usage for operations that must be processed in order.Global homomorphic operations complexity per transaction: Controls HCU usage for operations that can be processed in parallel.If either limit is exceeded, the transaction will revert.HCU limitThe current devnet has an HCU limit of 20,000,000 per transaction and an HCU depth limit of 5,000,000 per transaction. If either HCU limit is exceeded, the transaction will revert.To resolve this, you must do one of the following:Refactor your code to reduce the number of FHE operations in your transaction.Split your FHE operations across multiple independent transactions.HCU costs for common operationsBoolean operations (ebool)and22,00025,000or22,00024,000xor2,00022,000not-2select-55,000randEbool-19,000Unsigned integer operationsHCU increase with the bit-width of the encrypted integer type.

# How to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract? | Protocol

How to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract? | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHow to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract?This short guide will walk you through converting a standard Solidity contract into one that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) using FHEVM. This approach lets you develop your contract logic as usual, then adapt it to support encrypted computation for privacy.For this guide, we will focus on a voting contract example.1. Start with a Standard Solidity ContractBegin by writing your voting contract in Solidity as you normally would. Focus on implementing the core logic and functionality.
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SimpleVoting {
mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
uint64 public yesVotes;
uint64 public noVotes;
uint256 public voteDeadline;
function vote(bool support) public {
require(block.timestamp <= voteDeadline, "Too late to vote");
require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
if (support) {
yesVotes += 1;
} else {
noVotes += 1;
}
}
function getResults() public view returns (uint64, uint64) {
return (yesVotes, noVotes);
}
}2. Identify Sensitive Data and OperationsReview your contract and determine which variables, functions, or computations require privacy. In this example, the vote counts (yesVotes, noVotes) and individual votes should be encrypted.3. Integrate FHEVM and update your business logic accordingly.Replace standard data types and operations with their FHEVM equivalents for the identified sensitive parts. Use encrypted types and FHEVM library functions to perform computations on encrypted data.
import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import {SepoliaConfig} from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract EncryptedSimpleVoting is SepoliaConfig {
enum VotingStatus {
Open,
DecryptionInProgress,
ResultsDecrypted
}
mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
VotingStatus public status;
uint64 public decryptedYesVotes;
uint64 public decryptedNoVotes;
uint256 public voteDeadline;
euint64 private encryptedYesVotes;
euint64 private encryptedNoVotes;
constructor() {
encryptedYesVotes = FHE.asEuint64(0);
encryptedNoVotes = FHE.asEuint64(0);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedYesVotes);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedNoVotes);
}
function vote(externalEbool support, bytes memory inputProof) public {
require(block.timestamp <= voteDeadline, "Too late to vote");
require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
ebool isSupport = FHE.fromExternal(support, inputProof);
encryptedYesVotes = FHE.select(isSupport, FHE.add(encryptedYesVotes, 1), encryptedYesVotes);
encryptedNoVotes = FHE.select(isSupport, encryptedNoVotes, FHE.add(encryptedNoVotes, 1));
FHE.allowThis(encryptedYesVotes);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedNoVotes);
}
function requestVoteDecryption() public {
require(block.timestamp > voteDeadline, "Voting is not finished");
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](2);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(encryptedYesVotes);
cts[1] = FHE.toBytes32(encryptedNoVotes);
uint256 requestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.callbackDecryptVotes.selector);
status = VotingStatus.DecryptionInProgress;
}
function callbackDecryptVotes(uint256 requestId, bytes memory cleartexts, bytes memory decryptionProof) public {
FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, cleartexts, decryptionProof);
(uint64 yesVotes, uint64 noVotes) = abi.decode(cleartexts, (uint64, uint64));
decryptedYesVotes = yesVotes;
decryptedNoVotes = noVotes;
status = VotingStatus.ResultsDecrypted;
}
function getResults() public view returns (uint64, uint64) {
require(status == VotingStatus.ResultsDecrypted, "Results were not decrypted");
return (
decryptedYesVotes,
decryptedNoVotes
);
}
}Adjust your contract’s code to accept and return encrypted data where necessary. This may involve changing function parameters and return types to work with ciphertexts instead of plaintext values, as shown above.The vote function now has two parameters: support and inputProof.The getResults can only be called after the decryption occurred. Otherwise, the decrypted results are not visible to anyone.However, it is far from being the main change. As this example illustrates, working with FHEVM often requires re-architecting the original logic to support privacy.In the updated code, the logic becomes async; results are hidden until a request (to the oracle) explicitely has to be made to decrypt publically the vote results.ConclusionAs this short guide showed, integrating with FHEVM not only requires integration with the FHEVM stack, it also requires refactoring your business logic to support mechanism to swift between encrypted and non-encrypted components of the logic.PreviousMigrate to v0.7Last updated 11 days ago

Deploy contracts and run tests | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHardhat pluginDeploy contracts and run testsIn this section, you'll find everything you need to test your FHEVM smart contracts in your Hardhat project.FHEVM Runtime ModesThe FHEVM Hardhat plugin provides three FHEVM runtime modes tailored for different stages of contract development and testing. Each mode offers a trade-off between speed, encryption, and persistence.The Hardhat (In-Memory) default network: 🧪 Uses mock encryption. Ideal for regular tests, CI test coverage, and fast feedback during early contract development. No real encryption is used.The Hardhat Node (Local Server) network: 🧪 Uses mock encryption. Ideal when you need persistent state - for example, when testing frontend interactions, simulating user flows, or validating deployments in a realistic local environment. Still uses mock encryption.The Sepolia Testnet network: 🔐 Uses real encryption. Use this mode once your contract logic is stable and validated locally. This is the only mode that runs on the full FHEVM stack with real encrypted values. It simulates real-world production conditions but is slower and requires Sepolia ETH.Zama Testnet is not a blockchain itself. It is a protocol that enables you to run confidential smart contracts on existing blockchains (such as Ethereum, Base, and others) with the support of encrypted types. See the FHE on blockchain guide to learn more about the protocol architecture.Currently, Zama Protocol is available on the Sepolia Testnet. Support for additional chains will be added in the future.

# Write FHEVM-enabled Hardhat Tasks | Protocol

Write FHEVM-enabled Hardhat Tasks | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHardhat pluginWrite FHEVM-enabled Hardhat TasksIn this section, you'll learn how to write a custom FHEVM Hardhat task.Writing tasks is a gas-efficient and flexible way to test your FHEVM smart contracts on the Sepolia network. Creating a custom task is straightforward.PrerequisiteYou should be familiar with Hardhat tasks. If you're new to them, refer to the Hardhat Tasks official documentation.You should have already completed the FHEVM Tutorial.This page provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the task:decrypt-count tasks included in the file tasks/FHECounter.ts file, located in the fhevm-hardhat-template repository.1A Basic Hardhat Task.Let’s start with a simple example: fetching the current counter value from a basic Counter.sol contract.If you're already familiar with Hardhat and custom tasks, the TypeScript code below should look familiar and be easy to follow:("task:get-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")
.addOptionalParam("address", "Optionally specify the Counter contract address")
.setAction(async function (taskArguments: TaskArguments, hre) {
const { ethers, deployments } = hre;
const CounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
? { address: taskArguments.address }
: await deployments.get("Counter");
console.log(`Counter: ${CounterDeployement.address}`);
const counterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("Counter", CounterDeployement.address);
const clearCount = await counterContract.getCount();
console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);
});Now, let’s modify this task to work with FHEVM encrypted values.2Comment Out Existing Logic and renameFirst, comment out the existing logic so we can incrementally add the necessary changes for FHEVM integration.("task:get-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")
.addOptionalParam("address", "Optionally specify the Counter contract address")
.setAction(async function (taskArguments: TaskArguments, hre) {
// const { ethers, deployments } = hre;
// const CounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
// ? { address: taskArguments.address }
// : await deployments.get("Counter");
// console.log(`Counter: ${CounterDeployement.address}`);
// const counterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("Counter", CounterDeployement.address);
// const clearCount = await counterContract.getCount();
// console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);
});Next, rename the task by replacing:("task:get-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")With:("task:decrypt-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")This updates the task name from task:get-count to task:decrypt-count, reflecting that it now includes decryption logic for FHE-encrypted values.3Initialize FHEVM CLI APIReplace the line:// const { ethers, deployments } = hre;With:const { ethers, deployments, fhevm } = hre;
await fhevm.initializeCLIApi();Calling initializeCLIApi() is essential. Unlike built-in Hardhat tasks like test or compile, which automatically initialize the FHEVM runtime environment, custom tasks require you to call this function explicitly. Make sure to call it at the very beginning of your task to ensure the environment is properly set up.4Call the view function getCount from the FHECounter contractReplace the following commented-out lines:// const CounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
// ? { address: taskArguments.address }
// : await deployments.get("Counter");
// console.log(`Counter: ${CounterDeployement.address}`);
// const counterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("Counter", CounterDeployement.address);
// const clearCount = await counterContract.getCount();With the FHEVM equivalent:const FHECounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
? { address: taskArguments.address }
: await deployments.get("FHECounter");
console.log(`FHECounter: ${FHECounterDeployement.address}`);
const fheCounterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("FHECounter", FHECounterDeployement.address);
const encryptedCount = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
if (encryptedCount === ethers.ZeroHash) {
console.log(`encrypted count: ${encryptedCount}`);
console.log("clear count : 0");

}Here, encryptedCount is an FHE-encrypted euint32 primitive. To retrieve the actual value, we need to decrypt it in the next step.5Decrypt the encrypted count value.Now replace the following commented-out line:// console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);With the decryption logic:const signers = await ethers.getSigners();
const clearCount = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCount,
FHECounterDeployement.address,
signers[0],
);
console.log(`Encrypted count: ${encryptedCount}`);
console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);At this point, your custom Hardhat task is fully configured to work with FHE-encrypted values and ready to run!6Step 6: Run your custom task using Hardhat NodeStart the Local Hardhat Node:Open a new terminal window.From the root project directory, run the following: hardhat nodeDeploy the FHECounter smart contract on the local Hardhat Node hardhat deploy --network localhostRun your custom task hardhat task:decrypt-count --network localhost7Step 7: Run your custom task using SepoliaDeploy the FHECounter smart contract on Sepolia Testnet (if not already deployed) hardhat deploy --network sepoliaExecute your custom task hardhat task:decrypt-count --network sepoliaPreviousDeploy contracts and run testsNextFoundryLast updated 11 days ago

# 4. Test the FHEVM contract | Protocol

4. Test the FHEVM contract | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick start tutorial4. Test the FHEVM contractIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to migrate a standard Hardhat test suite - from Counter.ts to its FHEVM-compatible version FHECounter.ts — and progressively enhance it to support Fully Homomorphic Encryption using Zama’s FHEVM library.Set up the FHEVM testing environment1Create a test script test/FHECounter.tsGo to your project's test directory <your-project-root-directory>/testFrom there, create a new file named FHECounter.ts and copy/paste the following Typescript skeleton code in it. { FHECounter, FHECounter__factory } from "../types";
import { FhevmType } from "@fhevm/hardhat-plugin";
import { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers, fhevm } from "hardhat";
type Signers = {
deployer: HardhatEthersSigner;
alice: HardhatEthersSigner;
bob: HardhatEthersSigner;
};
async function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("FHECounter")) as FHECounter__factory;
const fheCounterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as FHECounter;
const fheCounterContractAddress = await fheCounterContract.getAddress();
return { fheCounterContract, fheCounterContractAddress };
}
describe("FHECounter", function () {
let signers: Signers;
let fheCounterContract: FHECounter;
let fheCounterContractAddress: string;
before(async function () {
const ethSigners: HardhatEthersSigner[] = await ethers.getSigners();
signers = { deployer: ethSigners[0], alice: ethSigners[1], bob: ethSigners[2] };
});
beforeEach(async () => {
({ fheCounterContract, fheCounterContractAddress } = await deployFixture());
});
it("should be deployed", async function () {
console.log(`FHECounter has been deployed at address ${fheCounterContractAddress}`);
// Test the deployed address is valid
expect(ethers.isAddress(fheCounterContractAddress)).to.eq(true);
});
// it("count should be zero after deployment", async function () {
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// console.log(`Counter.getCount() === ${count}`);
// // Expect initial count to be 0 after deployment
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });
// it("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
// const countBeforeInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
// });
// it("decrement the counter by 1", async function () {
// // First increment, count becomes 1
// let tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment();
// await tx.wait();
// // Then decrement, count goes back to 0
// tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });
});What’s Different from Counter.ts?This test file is structurally similar to the original Counter.ts, but it uses the FHEVM-compatible smart contract FHECounter instead of the regular Counter.– For clarity, the Counter unit tests are included as comments, allowing you to better understand how each part is adapted during the migration to FHEVM.While the test logic remains the same, this version is now set up to support encrypted computations via the FHEVM library — enabling tests that manipulate confidential values directly on-chain.2Run the test test/FHECounter.tsFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testOutput:FHECounter

✔ should be deployed
1 passing (1ms)Great! Your Hardhat FHEVM test environment is properly setup.Test functionsNow everything is up and running, you can start testing your contract functions.1Call the contract getCount() view functionReplace the commented‐out test for the legacy Counter contract:
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// console.log(`Counter.getCount() === ${count}`);
// // Expect initial count to be 0 after deployment
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });with its FHEVM equivalent:("encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment", async function () {
const encryptedCount = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
// Expect initial count to be bytes32(0) after deployment,
// (meaning the encrypted count value is uninitialized)
expect(encryptedCount).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
});What’s different?– encryptedCount is no longer a plain TypeScript number. It is now a hexadecimal string representing a Solidity bytes32 value, known as an FHEVM handle. This handle points to an encrypted FHEVM primitive of type euint32, which internally represents an encrypted Solidity uint32 primitive type.encryptedCount is equal to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 which means that encryptedCount is uninitialized, and does not reference to any encrypted value at this point.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputCounter

✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
2 passing (7ms)2Setup the increment() function unit testWe’ll migrate the increment() unit test to FHEVM step by step. To start, let’s handle the value of the counter before the first increment. As explained above, the counter is initially a bytes32 value equal to zero, meaning the FHEVM euint32 variable is uninitialized.We’ll interpret this as if the underlying clear value is 0.Replace the commented‐out test for the legacy Counter contract:
// const countBeforeInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
// });with the following:("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});3Encrypt the increment() function argumentThe increment() function takes a single argument: the value by which the counter should be incremented. In the initial version of Counter.sol, this value is a clear uint32.We’ll switch to passing an encrypted value instead, using FHEVM externalEuint32 primitive type. This allows us to securely increment the counter without revealing the input value on-chain.We are using an externalEuint32 instead of a regular euint32. This tells the FHEVM that the encrypted uint32 was provided externally (e.g., by a user) and must be verified for integrity and authenticity before it can be used within the contract.Replace :("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});with the following:("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// Encrypt constant 1 as a euint32
const clearOne = 1;
const encryptedOne = await fhevm
.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address)
.add32(clearOne)
.encrypt();
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});fhevm.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address) creates an encrypted value that is bound to both the contract (fheCounterContractAddress) and the user (signers.alice.address). This means only Alice can use this encrypted value, and only within the FHECounter.sol contract at that specific address. It cannot be reused by another user or in a different contract, ensuring data confidentiality and binding context-specific encryption.4Call the increment() function with the encrypted argumentNow that we have an encrypted argument, we can call the increment() function with it.Below, you’ll notice that the updated increment() function now takes two arguments instead of one.This is because the FHEVM requires both:The externalEuint32 — the encrypted value itselfAn accompanying Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (inputProof) — which verifies that the encrypted input is securely bound to:the caller (Alice, the transaction signer), andthe target smart contract (where increment() is being executed)This ensures that the encrypted value cannot be reused in a different context or by a different user, preserving confidentiality and integrity.Replace :
// await tx.wait();with the following: tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();At this point the counter has been successfully incremented by 1 using a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). In the next step, we will retrieve the updated encrypted counter value and decrypt it locally. But before we move on, let’s quickly run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter

✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
3 passing (7ms)5Call the getCount() function and Decrypt the valueNow that the counter has been incremented using an encrypted input, it's time to read the updated encrypted value from the smart contract and decrypt it using the userDecryptEuint function provided by the FHEVM Hardhat Plugin.The userDecryptEuint function takes four parameters:FhevmType: The integer type of the FHE-encrypted value. In this case, we're using FhevmType.euint32 because the counter is a uint32.Encrypted handle: A 32-byte FHEVM handle representing the encrypted value you want to decrypt.Smart contract address: The address of the contract that has permission to access the encrypted handle.User signer: The signer (e.g., signers.alice) who has permission to access the handle.Note: Permissions to access the FHEVM handle are set on-chain using the FHE.allow() Solidity function (see FHECounter.sol).Replace :
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);with the following: encryptedCountAfterInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
const clearCountAfterInc = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCountAfterInc,
fheCounterContractAddress,
signers.alice,
);
expect(clearCountAfterInc).to.eq(clearCountBeforeInc + clearOne);Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter

✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
3 passing (7ms)6Call the contract decrement() functionSimilarly to the previous test, we’ll now call the decrement() function using an encrypted input.Replace :
// // First increment, count becomes 1
// let tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment();
// await tx.wait();
// // Then decrement, count goes back to 0
// tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });with the following:("decrement the counter by 1", async function () {
// Encrypt constant 1 as a euint32
const clearOne = 1;
const encryptedOne = await fhevm
.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address)
.add32(clearOne)
.encrypt();
// First increment by 1, count becomes 1
let tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();
// Then decrement by 1, count goes back to 0
tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();
const encryptedCountAfterDec = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
const clearCountAfterDec = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCountAfterDec,
fheCounterContractAddress,
signers.alice,
);
expect(clearCountAfterDec).to.eq(0);

# 3. Turn it into FHEVM | Protocol

3. Turn it into FHEVM | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick start tutorial3. Turn it into FHEVMIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to take a basic Solidity smart contract and progressively upgrade it to support Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the FHEVM library by Zama.Starting with the plain Counter.sol contract that you built from the "Write a simple contract" tutorial, and step-by-step, you’ll learn how to:Replace standard types with encrypted equivalentsIntegrate zero-knowledge proof validationEnable encrypted on-chain computationGrant permissions for secure off-chain decryptionBy the end, you'll have a fully functional smart contract that supports FHE computation.Initiate the contract1Create the FHECounter.sol fileNavigate to your project’s contracts directory: <your-project-root-directory>/contractsFrom there, create a new file named FHECounter.sol, and copy the following Solidity code into it:
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
/// @title A simple counter contract
contract Counter {
uint32 private _count;
/// @notice Returns the current count
function getCount() external view returns (uint32) {
return _count;
}
/// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(uint32 value) external {
_count += value;
}
/// @notice Decrements the counter by a specific value
function decrement(uint32 value) external {
require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
_count -= value;
}
}This is a plain Counter contract that we’ll use as the starting point for adding FHEVM functionality. We will modify this contract step-by-step to progressively integrate FHEVM capabilities.2Turn Counter into FHECounterTo begin integrating FHEVM features into your contract, we first need to import the required FHEVM libraries.Replace the current header
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;With this updated header:
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import { FHE, euint32, externalEuint32 } from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";These imports:FHE — the core library to work with FHEVM encrypted typeseuint32 and externalEuint32 — encrypted uint32 types used in FHEVMSepoliaConfig — provides the FHEVM configuration for the Sepolia network.
Inheriting from it enables your contract to use the FHE libraryReplace the current contract declaration:@title A simple counter contract
contract Counter {With the updated declaration :@title A simple FHE counter contract
contract FHECounter is SepoliaConfig {This change:Renames the contract to FHECounterInherits from SepoliaConfig to enable FHEVM supportThis contract must inherit from the SepoliaConfig abstract contract; otherwise, it will not be able to execute any FHEVM-related functionality on Sepolia or Hardhat.From your project's root directory, run: hardhat compileGreat! Your smart contract is now compiled and ready to use FHEVM features.Apply FHE functions and types1Comment out the increment() and decrement() FunctionsBefore we move forward, let’s comment out the increment() and decrement() functions in FHECounter. We'll replace them later with updated versions that support FHE-encrypted operations./// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
// function increment(uint32 value) external {
// _count += value;
// }
/// @notice Decrements the counter by a specific value
// function decrement(uint32 value) external {
// require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
// _count -= value;
// }2Replace uint32 with the FHEVM euint32 TypeWe’ll now switch from the standard Solidity uint32 type to the encrypted FHEVM type euint32.This enables private, homomorphic computation on encrypted integers.Replace _count;and getCount() external view returns (uint32) {With :and getCount() external view returns (euint32) {3Replace increment(uint32 value) with the FHEVM version increment(externalEuint32 value)To support encrypted input, we will update the increment function to accept a value encrypted off-chain.Instead of using a uint32, the new version will accept an externalEuint32, which is an encrypted integer produced off-chain and sent to the smart contract.To ensure the validity of this encrypted value, we also include a second argument:inputProof, a bytes array containing a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPoK) that proves two things:The externalEuint32 was encrypted off-chain by the function caller (msg.sender)The externalEuint32 is bound to the contract (address(this)) and can only be processed by it.Replace/// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
// function increment(uint32 value) external {
// _count += value;
// }With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
// _count += value;
}4Convert externalEuint32 to euint32You cannot directly use externalEuint32 in FHE operations. To manipulate it with the FHEVM library, you first need to convert it into the native FHE type euint32.This conversion is done using:fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);This method verifies the zero-knowledge proof and returns a usable encrypted value within the contract.Replace@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
// _count += value;
}With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
// _count += value;
}5Convert _count += value into its FHEVM equivalentTo perform the update _count += value in a Fully Homomorphic way, we use the FHE.add() operator. This function allows us to compute the FHE sum of 2 encrypted integers.Replace@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
// _count += value;
}With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
}This FHE operation allows the smart contract to process encrypted values without ever decrypting them — a core feature of FHEVM that enables on-chain privacy.Grant FHE PermissionsThis step is critical! You must grant FHE permissions to both the contract and the caller to ensure the encrypted _count value can be decrypted off-chain by the caller. Without these 2 permissions, the caller will not be able to compute the clear result.To grant FHE permission we will call the FHE.allow() function.Replacefunction increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
}With :function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
FHE.allowThis(_count);
FHE.allow(_count, msg.sender);
}We grant two FHE permissions here — not just one. In the next part of the tutorial, you'll learn why both are necessary.Convert decrement() to its FHEVM equivalentJust like with the increment() migration, we’ll now convert the decrement() function to its FHEVM-compatible version.Replace :function decrement(uint32 value) external {

# 2. Write a simple contract | Protocol

2. Write a simple contract | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick start tutorial2. Write a simple contractIn this tutorial, you'll write and test a simple regular Solidity smart contract within the FHEVM Hardhat template to get familiar with Hardhat workflow.In the next tutorial, you'll learn how to convert this contract into an FHEVM contract.PrerequisiteSet up your Hardhat envrionment.Make sure that you Hardhat project is clean and ready to start. See the instructions here.What you'll learnBy the end of this tutorial, you will learn to:Write a minimal Solidity contract using Hardhat.Test the contract using TypeScript and Hardhat’s testing framework.Write a simple contract1Create Counter.solGo to your project's contracts directory: <your-project-root-directory>/contractsFrom there, create a new file named Counter.sol and copy/paste the following Solidity code in it.
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
/// @title A simple counter contract
contract Counter {
uint32 private _count;
/// @notice Returns the current count
function getCount() external view returns (uint32) {
return _count;
}
/// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(uint32 value) external {
_count += value;
}
/// @notice Decrements the counter by a specific value
function decrement(uint32 value) external {
require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
_count -= value;
}
}2Compile Counter.solFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat compileGreat! Your Smart Contract is now compiled.Set up the testing environment1Create a test script test/Counter.tsGo to your project's test directory <your-project-root-directory>/testFrom there, create a new file named Counter.ts and copy/paste the following Typescript skeleton code in it. { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
describe("Counter", function () {
it("empty test", async function () {
console.log("Cool! The test basic skeleton is running!");
});
});The file contains the following:all the required import statements we will need during the various testsThe chai basic statements to run a first empty test named empty test2Run the test test/Counter.tsFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testOutput:Counter
Cool! The test basic skeleton is running!
✔ empty test
1 passing (1ms)Great! Your Hardhat test environment is properly setup.3Set up the test signersBefore interacting with smart contracts in Hardhat tests, we need to initialize signers.In the context of Ethereum development, a signer represents an entity (usually a wallet) that can send transactions and sign messages. In Hardhat, ethers.getSigners() returns a list of pre-funded test accounts.We’ll define three named signers for convenience:owner — the deployer of the contractalice and bob — additional simulated usersReplace the contents of test/Counter.ts with the following: { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
type Signers = {
owner: HardhatEthersSigner;
alice: HardhatEthersSigner;
bob: HardhatEthersSigner;
};
describe("Counter", function () {
let signers: Signers;
before(async function () {
const ethSigners: HardhatEthersSigner[] = await ethers.getSigners();
signers = { owner: ethSigners[0], alice: ethSigners[1], bob: ethSigners[2] };
});
it("should work", async function () {
console.log(`address of user owner is ${signers.owner.address}`);
console.log(`address of user alice is ${signers.alice.address}`);
console.log(`address of user bob is ${signers.bob.address}`);
});
});Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputCounter
address of user owner is 0x37AC010c1c566696326813b840319B58Bb5840E4

address of user bob is 0x3f0CdAe6ebd93F9F776BCBB7da1D42180cC8fcC1
✔ should work
1 passing (2ms)4Set up testing instanceNow that we have our signers set up, we can deploy the smart contract.To ensure isolated and deterministic tests, we should deploy a fresh instance of Counter.sol before each test. This avoids any side effects from previous tests.The standard approach is to define a deployFixture() function that handles contract deployment. function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("Counter")) as Counter__factory;
const counterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as Counter;
const counterContractAddress = await counterContract.getAddress();
return { counterContract, counterContractAddress };
}To run this setup before each test case, call deployFixture() inside a beforeEach block:(async () => {
({ counterContract, counterContractAddress } = await deployFixture());
});This ensures each test runs with a clean, independent contract instance.Let's put it together. Now yourtest/Counter.ts should look like the following: { Counter, Counter__factory } from "../types";
import { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
type Signers = {
deployer: HardhatEthersSigner;
alice: HardhatEthersSigner;
bob: HardhatEthersSigner;
};
async function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("Counter")) as Counter__factory;
const counterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as Counter;
const counterContractAddress = await counterContract.getAddress();
return { counterContract, counterContractAddress };
}
describe("Counter", function () {
let signers: Signers;
let counterContract: Counter;
let counterContractAddress: Counter;
before(async function () {
const ethSigners: HardhatEthersSigner[] = await ethers.getSigners();
signers = { deployer: ethSigners[0], alice: ethSigners[1], bob: ethSigners[2] };
});
beforeEach(async () => {
// Deploy a new instance of the contract before each test
({ counterContract, counterContractAddress } = await deployFixture());
});
it("should be deployed", async function () {
console.log(`Counter has been deployed at address ${counterContractAddress}`);
// Test the deployed address is valid
expect(ethers.isAddress(counterContractAddress)).to.eq(true);
});
});Run the test:From your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected Output:Counter
Counter has been deployed at address 0x7553CB9124f974Ee475E5cE45482F90d5B6076BC
✔ should be deployed
1 passing (7ms)Test functionsNow everything is up and running, you can start testing your contract functions.1Call the contract getCount() view functionEverything is up and running, we can now call the Counter.sol view function getCount() !Just below the test block it("should be deployed", async function () {...},add the following unit test: const count = await counterContract.getCount();
console.log(`Counter.getCount() === ${count}`);
// Expect initial count to be 0 after deployment
expect(count).to.eq(0);
});Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run:Expected OutputCounter has been deployed at address 0x7553CB9124f974Ee475E5cE45482F90d5B6076BC
✔ should be deployed
Counter.getCount() === 0
✔ count should be zero after deployment
1 passing (7ms)2Call the contract increment() transaction functionJust below the test block it("count should be zero after deployment", async function () {...}, add the following test block: const countBeforeInc = await counterContract.getCount();
const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
await tx.wait();
const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});Remarks:increment() is a transactional function that modifies the blockchain state.It must be signed by a user — here we use alice.await wait() to wait for the transaction to mined.The test compares the counter before and after the transaction to ensure it incremented as expected.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run:Expected OutputCounter has been deployed at address 0x7553CB9124f974Ee475E5cE45482F90d5B6076BC
✔ should be deployed
Counter.getCount() === 0
✔ count should be zero after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
2 passing (12ms)3Call the contract decrement() transaction functionJust below the test block it("increment the counter by 1", async function () {...},add the following test block: // First increment, count becomes 1
let tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
await tx.wait();
// Then decrement, count goes back to 0
tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(1);
await tx.wait();
const count = await counterContract.getCount();
expect(count).to.eq(0);
});Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run:Expected OutputCounter has been deployed at address 0x7553CB9124f974Ee475E5cE45482F90d5B6076BC
✔ should be deployed
Counter.getCount() === 0
✔ count should be zero after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
✔ decrement the counter by 1
2 passing (12ms)Now you have successfully written and tested your counter contract. You should have the following files in your project:contracts/Counter.sol — your Solidity smart contracttest/Counter.ts — your Hardhat test suite written in TypeScriptThese files form the foundation of a basic Hardhat-based smart contract project.Next stepNow that you've written and tested a basic Solidity smart contract, you're ready to take the next step.In the next tutorial, we’ll transform this standard Counter.sol contract into FHECounter.sol, a trivial FHEVM-compatible version — allowing the counter value to be stored and updated using trivial fully homomorphic encryption.PreviousQuick start tutorialNext3.

# Configuration | Protocol

Configuration | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageConfigurationThis document explains how to enable encrypted computations in your smart contract by setting up the fhevm environment. Learn how to integrate essential libraries, configure encryption, and add secure computation logic to your contracts.Core configuration setupTo utilize encrypted computations in Solidity contracts, you must configure the FHE library and Oracle addresses. The fhevm package simplifies this process with prebuilt configuration contracts, allowing you to focus on developing your contract’s logic without handling the underlying cryptographic setup.This library and its associated contracts provide a standardized way to configure and interact with Zama's FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) infrastructure on different Ethereum networks. It supplies the necessary contract addresses for Zama's FHEVM components (ACL, FHEVMExecutor, KMSVerifier, InputVerifier) and the decryption oracle, enabling seamless integration for Solidity contracts that require FHEVM support.Key components configured automaticallyFHE library: Sets up encryption parameters and cryptographic keys.Oracle: Manages secure cryptographic operations such as public decryption.Network-specific settings: Adapts to local testing, testnets (Sepolia for example), or mainnet deployment.By inheriting these configuration contracts, you ensure seamless initialization and functionality across environments.ZamaConfig.solThe ZamaConfig library exposes functions to retrieve FHEVM configuration structs and oracle addresses for supported networks (currently only the Sepolia testnet).Under the hood, this library encapsulates the network-specific addresses of Zama's FHEVM infrastructure into a single struct (FHEVMConfigStruct).SepoliaConfigThe SepoliaConfig contract is designed to be inherited by a user contract. The constructor automatically sets up the FHEVM coprocessor and decryption oracle using the configuration provided by the library for the respective network. When a contract inherits from SepoliaConfig, the constructor calls FHE.setCoprocessor and FHE.setDecryptionOracle with the appropriate addresses. This ensures that the inheriting contract is automatically wired to the correct FHEVM contracts and oracle for the target network, abstracting away manual address management and reducing the risk of misconfiguration.Example: using Sepolia configurationpragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract MyERC20 is SepoliaConfig {
constructor() {
// Additional initialization logic if needed
}
}Using isInitializedThe isInitialized utility function checks whether an encrypted variable has been properly initialized, preventing unexpected behavior due to uninitialized values.Function signaturePurposeEnsures encrypted variables are initialized before use.Prevents potential logic errors in contract execution.Example: Initialization Check for Encrypted CounterSummaryBy leveraging prebuilt a configuration contract like SepoliaConfig in ZamaConfig.sol, you can efficiently set up your smart contract for encrypted computations. These tools abstract the complexity of cryptographic initialization, allowing you to focus on building secure, confidential smart contracts.Previous4.

# Encrypted inputs | Protocol

Encrypted inputs | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageEncrypted inputsThis document introduces the concept of encrypted inputs in the FHEVM, explaining their role, structure, validation process, and how developers can integrate them into smart contracts and applications.Encrypted inputs are a core feature of FHEVM, enabling users to push encrypted data onto the blockchain while ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.What are encrypted inputs?Encrypted inputs are data values submitted by users in ciphertext form. These inputs allow sensitive information to remain confidential while still being processed by smart contracts. They are accompanied by Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPoKs) to ensure the validity of the encrypted data without revealing the plaintext.Key characteristics of encrypted inputs:Confidentiality: Data is encrypted using the public FHE key, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt or process the values.Validation via ZKPoKs: Each encrypted input is accompanied by a proof verifying that the user knows the plaintext value of the ciphertext, preventing replay attacks or misuse.Efficient packing: All inputs for a transaction are packed into a single ciphertext in a user-defined order, optimizing the size and generation of the zero-knowledge proof.Parameters in encrypted functionsWhen a function in a smart contract is called, it may accept two types of parameters for encrypted inputs:externalEbool, externalEaddress,externalEuintXX: Refers to the index of the encrypted parameter within the proof, representing a specific encrypted input handle.bytes: Contains the ciphertext and the associated zero-knowledge proof used for validation.Here’s an example of a Solidity function accepting multiple encrypted parameters: exampleFunction(
externalEbool param1,
externalEuint64 param2,
externalEuint8 param3,
bytes calldata inputProof
) public {
// Function logic here
}In this example, param1, param2, and param3 are encrypted inputs for ebool, euint64, and euint8 while inputProof contains the corresponding ZKPoK to validate their authenticity.Input Generation using HardhatIn the below example, we use Alice's address to create the encrypted inputs and submits the transaction.
const input = fhevm.createEncryptedInput(contract.address, signers.alice.address);
input.addBool(canTransfer); // at index 0
input.add64(transferAmount); // at index 1
input.add8(transferType); // at index 2
const encryptedInput = await input.encrypt();
const externalEboolParam1 = encryptedInput.handles[0];
const externalEuint64Param2 = encryptedInput.handles[1];
const externalEuint8Param3 = encryptedInput.handles[2];
const inputProof = encryptedInput.inputProof;
tx = await myContract
.connect(signers.alice)
[
"exampleFunction(bytes32,bytes32,bytes32,bytes)"
](signers.bob.address, externalEboolParam1, externalEuint64Param2, externalEuint8Param3, inputProof);
await tx.wait();Input OrderDevelopers are free to design the function parameters in any order. There is no required correspondence between the order in which encrypted inputs are constructed in TypeScript and the order of arguments in the Solidity function.Validating encrypted inputsSmart contracts process encrypted inputs by verifying them against the associated zero-knowledge proof. This is done using the FHE.asEuintXX, FHE.asEbool, or FHE.asEaddress functions, which validate the input and convert it into the appropriate encrypted type.Example validationThis example demonstrates a function that performs multiple encrypted operations, such as updating a user's encrypted balance and toggling an encrypted boolean flag: // Validate and convert the encrypted inputs
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
ebool toggleFlag = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedToggle, inputProof);
// Update the user's encrypted balance
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], amount);
// Toggle the user's encrypted flag
userFlags[msg.sender] = FHE.not(toggleFlag);
// FHE permissions and function logic here
...
}
// Function to retrieve a user's encrypted balance
function getEncryptedBalance() public view returns (euint64) {
return balances[msg.sender];
}
// Function to retrieve a user's encrypted flag
function getEncryptedFlag() public view returns (ebool) {
return userFlags[msg.sender];
}Example validation in the ConfidentialERC20.sol smart contractHere’s an example of a smart contract function that verifies an encrypted input before proceeding: address to,
externalEuint64 encryptedAmount,
bytes calldata inputProof
) public {
// Verify the provided encrypted amount and convert it into an encrypted uint64
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
// Function logic here, such as transferring funds
...
}How validation worksInput verification:
The FHE.fromExternal function ensures that the input is a valid ciphertext with a corresponding ZKPoK.Type conversion:
The function transforms externalEbool, externalEaddress, externalEuintXX into the appropriate encrypted type (ebool, eaddress, euintXX) for further operations within the contract.Best PracticesInput packing: Minimize the size and complexity of zero-knowledge proofs by packing all encrypted inputs into a single ciphertext.Frontend encryption: Always encrypt inputs using the FHE public key on the client side to ensure data confidentiality.Proof management: Ensure that the correct zero-knowledge proof is associated with each encrypted input to avoid validation errors.Encrypted inputs and their validation form the backbone of secure and private interactions in the FHEVM. By leveraging these tools, developers can create robust, privacy-preserving smart contracts without compromising functionality or scalability.PreviousGenerate random numbersNextAccess Control ListLast updated 3 months ago

# Operations on encrypted types | Protocol

Operations on encrypted types | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesThis document outlines the operations supported on encrypted types in the FHE library, enabling arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, and more on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) ciphertexts.Arithmetic operationsThe following arithmetic operations are supported for encrypted integers (euintX):AddFHE.add+BinarySubtractFHE.sub-BinaryMultiplyFHE.mul*BinaryDivide (plaintext divisor)FHE.divBinaryReminder (plaintext divisor)FHE.remBinaryNegationFHE.neg-UnaryMinFHE.minBinaryMaxFHE.maxBinaryDivision (FHE.div) and remainder (FHE.rem) operations are currently supported only with plaintext divisors.Bitwise operationsThe FHE library also supports bitwise operations, including shifts and rotations:Bitwise ANDFHE.and&BinaryBitwise ORFHE.or|BinaryBitwise XORFHE.xor^BinaryBitwise NOTFHE.not~UnaryShift RightFHE.shrBinaryShift LeftFHE.shlBinaryRotate RightFHE.rotrBinaryRotate LeftFHE.rotlBinaryThe shift operators FHE.shr and FHE.shl can take any encrypted type euintX as a first operand and either a uint8or a euint8 as a second operand, however the second operand will always be computed modulo the number of bits of the first operand. For example, FHE.shr(euint64 x, 70) is equivalent to FHE.shr(euint64 x, 6) because 70 % 64 = 6. This differs from the classical shift operators in Solidity, where there is no intermediate modulo operation, so for instance any uint64 shifted right via >> would give a null result.Comparison operationsEncrypted integers can be compared using the following functions:EqualFHE.eqBinaryNot equalFHE.neBinaryGreater than or equalFHE.geBinaryGreater thanFHE.gtBinaryLess than or equalFHE.leBinaryLess thanFHE.ltBinaryTernary operationThe FHE.select function is a ternary operation that selects one of two encrypted values based on an encrypted condition:SelectFHE.selectTernaryRandom operationsYou can generate cryptographically secure random numbers fully on-chain:NameFunction NameSymbolTypeRandom Unsigned IntegerFHE.randEuintX()RandomFor more details, refer to the Random Encrypted Numbers document.Best PracticesHere are some best practices to follow when using encrypted operations in your smart contracts:Use the appropriate encrypted type sizeChoose the smallest encrypted type that can accommodate your data to optimize gas costs. For example, use euint8 for small numbers (0-255) rather than euint256.❌ Avoid using oversized types:euint64 age = FHE.asEuint128(25); // age will never exceed 255
euint64 percentage = FHE.asEuint128(75); // percentage is 0-100✅ Instead, use the smallest appropriate type:euint8 age = FHE.asEuint8(25); // age fits in 8 bits
euint8 percentage = FHE.asEuint8(75); // percentage fits in 8 bitsUse scalar operands when possible to save gasSome FHE operators exist in two versions: one where all operands are ciphertexts handles, and another where one of the operands is an unencrypted scalar. Whenever possible, use the scalar operand version, as this will save a lot of gas.❌ For example, this snippet cost way more in gas:...
x = FHE.add(x,FHE.asEuint(42));✅ Than this one:// ...
x = FHE.add(x,42);Despite both leading to the same encrypted result!Beware of overflows of FHE arithmetic operatorsFHE arithmetic operators can overflow. Do not forget to take into account such a possibility when implementing FHEVM smart contracts.❌ For example, if you wanted to create a mint function for an encrypted ERC20 token with an encrypted totalSupply state variable, this code is vulnerable to overflows: euint32 mintedAmount = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
totalSupply = FHE.add(totalSupply, mintedAmount);
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], mintedAmount);
FHE.allowThis(balances[msg.sender]);
FHE.allow(balances[msg.sender], msg.sender);
}✅ But you can fix this issue by using FHE.select to cancel the mint in case of an overflow: euint32 mintedAmount = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
euint32 tempTotalSupply = FHE.add(totalSupply, mintedAmount);
ebool isOverflow = FHE.lt(tempTotalSupply, totalSupply);
totalSupply = FHE.select(isOverflow, totalSupply, tempTotalSupply);
euint32 tempBalanceOf = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], mintedAmount);
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.select(isOverflow, balances[msg.sender], tempBalanceOf);
FHE.allowThis(balances[msg.sender]);
FHE.allow(balances[msg.sender], msg.sender);
}Notice that we did not check separately the overflow on balances[msg.sender] but only on totalSupply variable, because totalSupply is the sum of the balances of all the users, so balances[msg.sender] could never overflow if totalSupply did not.PreviousSupported typesNextAsEbool, asEuintXX, and asEaddress operationsLast updated 3 months ago

# Decryption | Protocol

Decryption | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageDecryptionThis section explains how to handle decryption in fhevm. Decryption allows plaintext data to be accessed when required for contract logic or user presentation, ensuring confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.Decryption is essential in two primary cases:Smart contract logic: A contract requires plaintext values for computations or decision-making.User interaction: Plaintext data needs to be revealed to all users, such as revealing the decision of the vote.OverviewDecryption in FHEVM is an asynchronous process that involves the Relayer and Key Management System (KMS). Here’s an example of how to safely request decryption in a contract.Example: asynchronous decryption in a contract solidity ^0.8.24;
import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract TestAsyncDecrypt is SepoliaConfig {
ebool xBool;
bool public yBool;
bool isDecryptionPending;
uint256 latestRequestId;
constructor() {
xBool = FHE.asEbool(true);
FHE.allowThis(xBool);
}
function requestBool() public {
require(!isDecryptionPending, "Decryption is in progress");
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](1);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(xBool);
uint256 latestRequestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.myCustomCallback.selector);
/// @dev This prevents sending multiple requests before the first callback was sent.
isDecryptionPending = true;
}
function myCustomCallback(uint256 requestId, bool decryptedInput, bytes[] memory signatures) public returns (bool) {
/// @dev This check is used to verify that the request id is the expected one.
require(requestId == latestRequestId, "Invalid requestId");
FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, signatures);
yBool = decryptedInput;
isDecryptionPending = false;
return yBool;
}
}Decryption in depthThis document provides a detailed guide on implementing decryption in your smart contracts using the DecryptionOracle in fhevm. It covers the setup, usage of the FHE.requestDecryption function, and testing with Hardhat.DecryptionOracle setupThe DecryptionOracle is pre-deployed on the FHEVM testnet. It uses a default relayer account specified in the .env file.Anyone can fulfill decryption requests but it is essential to add signature verification (and to include a logic to invalidate the replay of decryption requests). The role of the DecryptionOracle contract is to independently verify the KMS signature during execution. This ensures that the relayers cannot manipulate or send fraudulent decryption results, even if compromised.There are two functions to consider: requestDecryption and checkSignatures.FHE.requestDecryption functionYou can call the function FHE.requestDecryption as such: bytes32[] calldata ctsHandles,

Supported types | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageSupported typesThis document introduces the encrypted integer types provided by the FHE library in FHEVM and explains their usage, including casting, state variable declarations, and type-specific considerations.IntroductionThe FHE library offers a robust type system with encrypted integer types, enabling secure computations on confidential data in smart contracts. These encrypted types are validated both at compile time and runtime to ensure correctness and security.Key features of encrypted typesEncrypted integers function similarly to Solidity’s native integer types, but they operate on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) ciphertexts.Arithmetic operations on e(u)int types are unchecked, meaning they wrap around on overflow. This design choice ensures confidentiality by avoiding the leakage of information through error detection.Future versions of the FHE library will support encrypted integers with overflow checking, but with the trade-off of exposing limited information about the operands.Encrypted integers with overflow checking will soon be available in the FHE library. These will allow reversible arithmetic operations but may reveal some information about the input values.Encrypted integers in FHEVM are represented as FHE ciphertexts, abstracted using ciphertext handles. These types, prefixed with e (for example, euint64) act as secure wrappers over the ciphertext handles.List of encrypted typesThe FHE library currently supports the following encrypted types:Ebool2and, or, xor, eq, ne, not, select, randEuint88add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint1616add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint3232add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint6464add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint128128add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint160160Eaddress (eq, ne, select)Euint256256and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedDivision (div) and remainder (rem) operations are only supported when the right-hand side (rhs) operand is a plaintext (non-encrypted) value. Attempting to use an encrypted value as rhs will result in a panic. This restriction ensures correct and secure computation within the current framework.Higher-precision integer types are available in the TFHE-rs library and can be added to fhevm as needed.PreviousContract addressesNextOperations on encrypted typesLast updated 3 months ago

AsEbool, asEuintXX, and asEaddress operations | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesAsEbool, asEuintXX, and asEaddress operationsThis documentation covers the asEbool, asEuintXX, and asEaddress operations provided by the FHE library for working with encrypted data in the FHEVM. These operations are essential for converting between plaintext and encrypted types, as well as handling encrypted inputs.The operations can be categorized into three main use cases:Trivial encryption: Converting plaintext values to encrypted typesType casting: Converting between different encrypted typesInput handling: Processing encrypted inputs with proofs1. Trivial encryptionTrivial encryption simply put is a plain text in a format of a ciphertext.OverviewTrivial encryption is the process of converting plaintext values into encrypted types (ciphertexts) compatible with FHE operators. Although the data is in ciphertext format, it remains publicly visible on-chain, making it useful for operations between public and private values.This type of casting involves converting plaintext (unencrypted) values into their encrypted equivalents, such as:bool → ebooluint → euintXXaddress → eaddressWhen doing trivial encryption, the data is made compatible with FHE operations but remains publicly visible on-chain unless explicitly encrypted.Exampleebool valueBool = FHE.asEbool(true); // Trivial encrypt a boolean2. Casting between encrypted typesThis type of casting is used to reinterpret or convert one encrypted type into another. For example:euint32 → euint64Casting between encrypted types is often required when working with operations that demand specific sizes or precisions.Important: When casting between encrypted types:Casting from smaller types to larger types (e.g. euint32 → euint64) preserves all informationCasting from larger types to smaller types (e.g. euint64 → euint32) will truncate and lose informationThe table below summarizes the available casting functions:euintXeuintXFHE.asEuintXXebooleuintXFHE.asEuintXXeuintXeboolFHE.asEboolXXCasting between encrypted types is efficient and often necessary when handling data with differing precision requirements.Workflow for encrypted typeseuint32 value32 = FHE.asEuint32(value64); // Cast to euint32

# Generate random numbers | Protocol

Generate random numbers | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesGenerate random numbersThis document explains how to generate cryptographically secure random encrypted numbers fully on-chain using the FHE library in fhevm. These numbers are encrypted and remain confidential, enabling privacy-preserving smart contract logic.Key notes on random number generationOn-chain execution: Random number generation must be executed during a transaction, as it requires the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state to be updated on-chain. This operation cannot be performed using the eth_call RPC method.Cryptographic security: The generated random numbers are cryptographically secure and encrypted, ensuring privacy and unpredictability.Random number generation must be performed during transactions, as it requires the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state to be mutated on-chain. Therefore, it cannot be executed using the eth_call RPC method.Basic usageThe FHE library allows you to generate random encrypted numbers of various bit sizes. Below is a list of supported types and their usage:
ebool rb = FHE.randEbool(); // Random encrypted boolean
euint8 r8 = FHE.randEuint8(); // Random 8-bit number
euint16 r16 = FHE.randEuint16(); // Random 16-bit number
euint32 r32 = FHE.randEuint32(); // Random 32-bit number
euint64 r64 = FHE.randEuint64(); // Random 64-bit number
euint128 r128 = FHE.randEuint128(); // Random 128-bit number
euint256 r256 = FHE.randEuint256(); // Random 256-bit numberExample: Random Boolean return FHE.randEbool();
}Bounded random numbersTo generate random numbers within a specific range, you can specify an upper bound. The random number will be in the range [0, upperBound - 1].euint8 r8 = FHE.randEuint8(100); // Random number between 0-99
euint16 r16 = FHE.randEuint16(1000); // Random number between 0-999
euint32 r32 = FHE.randEuint32(1000000); // Random number between 0-999999Example: Random bumber with upper bound return FHE.randEuint16(upperBound);
}Security ConsiderationsCryptographic security:
The random numbers are generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) and remain encrypted until explicitly decrypted.Gas consumption:
Each call to a random number generation function consumes gas. Developers should optimize the use of these functions, especially in gas-sensitive contracts.Privacy guarantee:
Random values are fully encrypted, ensuring they cannot be accessed or predicted by unauthorized parties.PreviousAsEbool, asEuintXX, and asEaddress operationsNextEncrypted inputsLast updated 3 months ago

# Branching | Protocol

Branching | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsBranchingThis document explains how to implement conditional logic (if/else branching) when working with encrypted values in FHEVM. Unlike typical Solidity programming, working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) requires specialized methods to handle conditions on encrypted data.This document covers encrypted branching and how to move from an encrypted condition to a non-encrypted business logic in your smart contract.What is confidential branching?In FHEVM, when you perform comparison operations, the result is an encrypted boolean (ebool). Since encrypted booleans do not support standard boolean operations like if statements or logical operators, conditional logic must be implemented using specialized methods.To facilitate conditional assignments, FHEVM provides the FHE.select function, which acts as a ternary operator for encrypted values.Using FHE.select for conditional logicThe FHE.select function enables branching logic by selecting one of two encrypted values based on an encrypted condition (ebool). It works as follows:select(condition, valueIfTrue, valueIfFalse);condition: An encrypted boolean (ebool) resulting from a comparison.valueIfTrue: The encrypted value to return if the condition is true.valueIfFalse: The encrypted value to return if the condition is false.Example: Auction Bidding LogicHere's an example of using conditional logic to update the highest winning number in a guessing game: bid(externalEuint64 encryptedValue, bytes calldata inputProof) external onlyBeforeEnd {
// Convert the encrypted input to an encrypted 64-bit integer
euint64 bid = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedValue, inputProof);
// Compare the current highest bid with the new bid
ebool isAbove = FHE.lt(highestBid, bid);
// Update the highest bid if the new bid is greater
highestBid = FHE.select(isAbove, bid, highestBid);
// Allow the contract to use the updated highest bid ciphertext
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
}This is a simplified example to demonstrate the functionality.How Does It Work?Comparison:The FHE.lt function compares highestBid and bid, returning an ebool (isAbove) that indicates whether the new bid is higher.Selection:The FHE.select function updates highestBid to either the new bid or the previous highest bid, based on the encrypted condition isAbove.Permission Handling:After updating highestBid, the contract reauthorizes itself to manipulate the updated ciphertext using FHE.allowThis.Key ConsiderationsValue change behavior: Each time FHE.select assigns a value, a new ciphertext is created, even if the underlying plaintext value remains unchanged. This behavior is inherent to FHE and ensures data confidentiality, but developers should account for it when designing their smart contracts.Gas consumption: Using FHE.select and other encrypted operations incurs additional gas costs compared to traditional Solidity logic. Optimize your code to minimize unnecessary operations.Access control: Always use appropriate ACL functions (e.g., FHE.allowThis, FHE.allow) to ensure the updated ciphertexts are authorized for use in future computations or transactions.How to branch to a non-confidential path?So far, this section only covered how to do branching using encrypted variables. However, there may be many cases where the "public" contract logic will depend on the outcome from a encrypted path.To do so, there are only one way to branch from an encrypted path to a non-encrypted path: it requires a public decryption using the oracle. Hence, any contract logic that requires moving from an encrypted input to a non-encrypted path always requires an async contract logic.Example: Auction Bidding Logic: Item ReleaseGoing back to our previous example with the auction bidding logic. Let's assume that the winner of the auction can receive some prize, which is not confidential.eaddress internal highestBidder;
euint64 internal highestBid;
function bid(externalEuint64 encryptedValue, bytes calldata inputProof) external onlyBeforeEnd {
// Convert the encrypted input to an encrypted 64-bit integer
euint64 bid = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedValue, inputProof);
// Compare the current highest bid with the new bid
ebool isAbove = FHE.lt(highestBid, bid);
// Update the highest bid if the new bid is greater
highestBid = FHE.select(isAbove, bid, highestBid);
// Update the highest bidder address if the new bid is greater
highestBidder = FHE.select(isAbove, FHE.asEaddress(msg.sender), currentBidder));
// Allow the contract to use the highest bidder address
FHE.allowThis(highestBidder);
// Allow the contract to use the updated highest bid ciphertext
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
}
function revealWinner() external onlyAfterEnd {
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](2);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(highestBidder);
uint256 requestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.transferPrize.selector);
}
function transferPrize(uint256 requestId, address auctionWinner, bytes memory signatures) external {
require(!isPrizeDistributed, "Prize has already been distributed");
FHE.verifySignatures(requestId, signatures)
isPrizeDistributed = true;
// Business logic to transfer the prize to the auction winner
}This is a simplified example to demonstrate the functionality.As you can see the in the above example, the path to move from an encrypted condition to a decrypted business logic must be async and requires calling the decryption oracle contract to reveal the result of the logic using encrypted variables.SummaryFHE.select is a powerful tool for conditional logic on encrypted values.Encrypted booleans (ebool) and values maintain confidentiality, enabling privacy-preserving logic.Developers should account for gas costs and ciphertext behavior when designing conditional operations.PreviousLogicsNextDealing with branches and conditionsLast updated 3 months ago

# Error handling | Protocol

Error handling | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsError handlingThis document explains how to handle errors effectively in FHEVM smart contracts. Since transactions involving encrypted data do not automatically revert when conditions are not met, developers need alternative mechanisms to communicate errors to users.Challenges in error handlingIn the context of encrypted data:No automatic reversion: Transactions do not revert if a condition fails, making it challenging to notify users of issues like insufficient funds or invalid inputs.Limited feedback: Encrypted computations lack direct mechanisms for exposing failure reasons while maintaining confidentiality.Recommended approach: Error logging with a handlerTo address these challenges, implement an error handler that records the most recent error for each user. This allows dApps or frontends to query error states and provide appropriate feedback to users.Example implementationThe following contract snippet demonstrates how to implement and use an error handler: LastError {
euint8 error; // Encrypted error code
uint timestamp; // Timestamp of the error
}
// Define error codes
euint8 internal NO_ERROR;
euint8 internal NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS;
constructor() {
NO_ERROR = FHE.asEuint8(0); // Code 0: No error
NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS = FHE.asEuint8(1); // Code 1: Insufficient funds
}
// Store the last error for each address
mapping(address => LastError) private _lastErrors;
// Event to notify about an error state change
event ErrorChanged(address indexed user);
/**
* @dev Set the last error for a specific address.
* @param error Encrypted error code.
* @param addr Address of the user.
*/
function setLastError(euint8 error, address addr) private {
_lastErrors[addr] = LastError(error, block.timestamp);
emit ErrorChanged(addr);
}
/**
* @dev Internal transfer function with error handling.
* @param from Sender's address.
* @param to Recipient's address.
* @param amount Encrypted transfer amount.
*/
function _transfer(address from, address to, euint32 amount) internal {
// Check if the sender has enough balance to transfer
ebool canTransfer = FHE.le(amount, balances[from]);
// Log the error state: NO_ERROR or NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS
setLastError(FHE.select(canTransfer, NO_ERROR, NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS), msg.sender);
// Perform the transfer operation conditionally
balances[to] = FHE.add(balances[to], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint32(0)));
FHE.allowThis(balances[to]);
FHE.allow(balances[to], to);
balances[from] = FHE.sub(balances[from], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint32(0)));
FHE.allowThis(balances[from]);
FHE.allow(balances[from], from);
}How It WorksDefine error codes:NO_ERROR: Indicates a successful operation.NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS: Indicates insufficient balance for a transfer.Record errors:Use the setLastError function to log the latest error for a specific address along with the current timestamp.Emit the ErrorChanged event to notify external systems (e.g., dApps) about the error state change.Conditional updates:Use the FHE.select function to update balances and log errors based on the transfer condition (canTransfer).Frontend integration:The dApp can query _lastErrors for a user’s most recent error and display appropriate feedback, such as "Insufficient funds" or "Transaction successful."Example error queryThe frontend or another contract can query the _lastErrors mapping to retrieve error details: * @dev Get the last error for a specific address.
* @param user Address of the user.
* @return error Encrypted error code.
* @return timestamp Timestamp of the error.
*/
function getLastError(address user) public view returns (euint8 error, uint timestamp) {
LastError memory lastError = _lastErrors[user];
return (lastError.error, lastError.timestamp);
}Benefits of this approachUser feedback:Provides actionable error messages without compromising the confidentiality of encrypted computations.Scalable error tracking:Logs errors per user, making it easy to identify and debug specific issues.Event-driven notifications:Enables frontends to react to errors in real time via the ErrorChanged event.By implementing error handlers as demonstrated, developers can ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining the privacy and integrity of encrypted data operations.PreviousDealing with branches and conditionsNextDecryptionLast updated 3 months ago

# Dealing with branches and conditions | Protocol

Dealing with branches and conditions | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsDealing with branches and conditionsThis document explains how to handle branches, loops or conditions when working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically when the condition / index is encrypted.Breaking a loop❌ In FHE, it is not possible to break a loop based on an encrypted condition. For example, this would not work:= FHE.asEuint(6); // Could be a value between 0 and 10
euint8 x = FHE.asEuint(0);
// some code
while(FHE.lt(x, maxValue)){
x = FHE.add(x, 2);
}If your code logic requires looping on an encrypted boolean condition, we highly suggest to try to replace it by a finite loop with an appropriate constant maximum number of steps and use FHE.select inside the loop.Suggested approach✅ For example, the previous code could maybe be replaced by the following snippet:= FHE.asEuint(6); // Could be a value between 0 and 10
euint8 x;
// some code
for (uint32 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
euint8 toAdd = FHE.select(FHE.lt(x, maxValue), 2, 0);
x = FHE.add(x, toAdd);
}In this snippet, we perform 10 iterations, adding 4 to x in each iteration as long as the iteration count is less than maxValue. If the iteration count exceeds maxValue, we add 0 instead for the remaining iterations because we can't break the loop.Best practicesObfuscate branchingThe previous paragraph emphasized that branch logic should rely as much as possible on FHE.select instead of decryptions. It hides effectively which branch has been executed.However, this is sometimes not enough. Enhancing the privacy of smart contracts often requires revisiting your application's logic.For example, if implementing a simple AMM for two encrypted ERC20 tokens based on a linear constant function, it is recommended to not only hide the amounts being swapped, but also the token which is swapped in a pair.✅ Here is a very simplified example implementation, we suppose here that the rate between tokenA and tokenB is constant and equals to 1:// ideally, the user already owns some amounts of both tokens and has pre-approved the AMM on both tokens
function swapTokensForTokens(
externalEuint32 encryptedAmountAIn,
externalEuint32 encryptedAmountBIn,
bytes calldata inputProof
) external {
euint32 encryptedAmountA = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmountAIn, inputProof); // even if amount is null, do a transfer to obfuscate trade direction
euint32 encryptedAmountB = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmountBIn, inputProof); // even if amount is null, do a transfer to obfuscate trade direction
// send tokens from user to AMM contract
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountA, tokenA);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenA).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountA);
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountB, tokenB);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenB).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountB);
// send tokens from AMM contract to user
// Price of tokenA in tokenB is constant and equal to 1, so we just swap the encrypted amounts here
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountB, tokenA);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenA).transfer(msg.sender, encryptedAmountB);
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountA, tokenB);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenB).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountA);
}Notice that to preserve confidentiality, we had to make two inputs transfers on both tokens from the user to the AMM contract, and similarly two output transfers from the AMM to the user, even if technically most of the times it will make sense that one of the user inputs encryptedAmountAIn or encryptedAmountBIn is actually an encrypted zero.This is different from a classical non-confidential AMM with regular ERC20 tokens: in this case, the user would need to just do one input transfer to the AMM on the token being sold, and receive only one output transfer from the AMM on the token being bought.Avoid using encrypted indexesUsing encrypted indexes to pick an element from an array without revealing it is not very efficient, because you would still need to loop on all the indexes to preserve confidentiality.However, there are plans to make this kind of operation much more efficient in the future, by adding specialized operators for arrays.For instance, imagine you have an encrypted array called encArray and you want to update an encrypted value x to match an item from this list, encArray[i], without disclosing which item you're choosing.❌ You must loop over all the indexes and check equality homomorphically, however this pattern is very expensive in gas and should be avoided whenever possible.euint32[] encArray;
function setXwithEncryptedIndex(externalEuint32 encryptedIndex, bytes calldata inputProof) public {
euint32 index = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedIndex, inputProof);
for (uint32 i = 0; i < encArray.length; i++) {
ebool isEqual = FHE.eq(index, i);
x = FHE.select(isEqual, encArray[i], x);
}
FHE.allowThis(x);

# ACL examples | Protocol

ACL examples | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListACL examplesThis page provides detailed instructions and examples on how to use and implement the ACL (Access Control List) in fhevm. For an overview of ACL concepts and their importance, refer to the access control list (ACL) overview.Controlling access: permanent and transient allowancesThe ACL system allows you to define two types of permissions for accessing ciphertexts:Permanent allowanceFunction: FHE.allow(ciphertext, address)Purpose: Grants persistent access to a ciphertext for a specific address.Storage: Permissions are saved in a dedicated ACL contract, making them available across transactions.Alternative Solidity syntaxYou can also use method-chaining syntax for granting allowances since FHE is a Solidity library. FHE for *;
ciphertext.allow(address1).allow(address2);This is equivalent to calling FHE.allow(ciphertext, address1) followed by FHE.allow(ciphertext, address2).Transient allowanceFunction: FHE.allowTransient(ciphertext, address)Purpose: Grants temporary access for the duration of a single transaction.Storage: Permissions are stored in transient storage to save gas costs.Use Case: Ideal for passing encrypted values between functions or contracts during a transaction.Alternative Solidity syntaxMethod chaining is also available for transient allowances since FHE is a Solidity library.ciphertext.allowTransient(address1).allowTransient(address2);Syntactic sugarFunction: FHE.allowThis(ciphertext)Equivalent To: FHE.allow(ciphertext, address(this))Purpose: Simplifies granting permanent access to the current contract for managing ciphertexts.Alternative Solidity syntaxYou can also use method-chaining syntax for allowThis since FHE is a Solidity library.ciphertext.allowThis();Make publicly decryptableTo make a ciphertext publicly decryptable, you can use the FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext) function. This grants decryption rights to anyone, which is useful for scenarios where the encrypted value should be accessible by all.FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext);
// Or using method syntax:
ciphertext.makePubliclyDecryptable();Function: FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext)Purpose: Makes the ciphertext decryptable by anyone.Use Case: When you want to publish encrypted results or data.You can combine multiple allowance methods (such as .allow(), .allowThis(), .allowTransient()) directly on ciphertext objects to grant access to several addresses or contracts in a single, fluent statement.Exampleciphertext.allowTransient(address1).allow(address2);
// Grant permanent access to the current contract and another address
ciphertext.allowThis().allow(address1);Best practicesVerifying sender accessWhen processing ciphertexts as input, it’s essential to validate that the sender is authorized to interact with the provided encrypted data. Failing to perform this verification can expose the system to inference attacks where malicious actors attempt to deduce private information.Example scenario: Confidential ERC20 attackConsider an Confidential ERC20 token. An attacker controlling two accounts, Account A and Account B, with 100 tokens in Account A, could exploit the system as follows:The attacker attempts to send the target user's encrypted balance from Account A to Account B.Observing the transaction outcome, the attacker gains information:If successful: The target's balance is equal to or less than 100 tokens.If failed: The target's balance exceeds 100 tokens.This type of attack allows the attacker to infer private balances without explicit access.To prevent this, always use the FHE.isSenderAllowed() function to verify that the sender has legitimate access to the encrypted amount being transferred.Example: secure verification // Ensure the sender is authorized to access the encrypted amount
require(FHE.isSenderAllowed(encryptedAmount), "Unauthorized access to encrypted amount.");
// Proceed with further logic
euint64 amount = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedAmount);
...
}By enforcing this check, you can safeguard against inference attacks and ensure that encrypted values are only manipulated by authorized entities.ACL for user decryptionIf a ciphertext can be decrypt by a user, explicit access must be granted to them. Additionally, the user decryption mechanism requires the signature of a public key associated with the contract address. Therefore, a value that needs to be decrypted must be explicitly authorized for both the user and the contract.Due to the user decryption mechanism, a user signs a public key associated with a specific contract; therefore, the ciphertext also needs to be allowed for the contract.Example: Secure Transfer in ConfidentialERC20 require(FHE.isSenderAllowed(encryptedAmount), "The caller is not authorized to access this encrypted amount.");
euint64 amount = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedAmount);
ebool canTransfer = FHE.le(amount, balances[msg.sender]);
euint64 newBalanceTo = FHE.add(balances[to], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint64(0)));
balances[to] = newBalanceTo;
// Allow this new balance for both the contract and the owner.
FHE.allowThis(newBalanceTo);
FHE.allow(newBalanceTo, to);
euint64 newBalanceFrom = FHE.sub(balances[from], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint64(0)));
balances[from] = newBalanceFrom;
// Allow this new balance for both the contract and the owner.
FHE.allowThis(newBalanceFrom);
FHE.allow(newBalanceFrom, from);

# Reorgs handling | Protocol

Reorgs handling | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListReorgs handlingThis page provides detailed instructions on how to handle reorg risks on Ethereum when using FHEVM.Since ACL events are propagated from the FHEVM host chain to the Gateway immediately after being included in a block, dApp developers must take special care when encrypted information is critically important. For example, if an encrypted handle conceals the private key of a Bitcoin wallet holding significant funds, we need to ensure that this information cannot inadvertently leak to the wrong person due to a reorg on the FHEVM host chain. Therefore, it's the responsibility of dApp developers to prevent such scenarios by implementing a two-step ACL authorization process with a timelock between the request and the ACL call.Simple example: Handling reorg risk on EthereumOn Ethereum, a reorg can be up to 95 slots deep in the worst case, so waiting for more than 95 blocks should ensure that a previously sent transaction has been finalized—unless more than 1/3 of the nodes are malicious and willing to lose their stake, which is highly improbable.❌ Instead of writing this contract: PrivateKeySale {
euint256 privateKey;
bool isAlreadyBought = false;
constructor(externalEuint256 _privateKey, bytes inputProof) {
privateKey = FHE.fromExternal(_privateKey, inputProof);
FHE.allowThis(privateKey);
}
function buyPrivateKey() external payable {
require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Must pay 1 ETH");
require(!isBought, "Private key already bought");
isBought = true;
FHE.allow(encryptedPrivateKey, msg.sender);
}
}Since the `privateKey`` encrypted variable contains critical information, we don't want to mistakenly leak it for free if a reorg occurs. This could happen in the previous example because we immediately grant authorization to the buyer in the same transaction that processes the sale.✅ We recommend writing something like this instead: euint256 privateKey;
bool isAlreadyBought = false;
uint256 blockWhenBought = 0;
address buyer;
constructor(externalEuint256 _privateKey, bytes inputProof) {
privateKey = FHE.fromExternal(_privateKey, inputProof);
FHE.allowThis(privateKey);
}
function buyPrivateKey() external payable {
require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Must pay 1 ETH");
require(!isBought, "Private key already bought");
isBought = true;
blockWhenBought = block.number;
buyer = msg.sender;
}
function requestACL() external {
require(isBought, "Private key has not been bought yet");
require(block.number > blockWhenBought + 95, "Too early to request ACL, risk of reorg");
FHE.allow(privateKey, buyer);
}
}This approach ensures that at least 96 blocks have elapsed between the transaction that purchases the private key and the transaction that authorizes the buyer to decrypt it.This type of contract worsens the user experience by adding a timelock before users can decrypt data, so it should be used sparingly: only when leaked information could be critically important and high-value.PreviousACL examplesNextLogicsLast updated 3 months ago

# HCU | Protocol

HCU | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHCUThis guide explains how to use Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) operations in your smart contracts on FHEVM. Understanding HCU is critical for designing efficient confidential smart contracts.OverviewFHE operations in FHEVM are computationally intensive compared to standard Ethereum operations, as they require complex mathematical computations to maintain privacy and security. To manage computational load and prevent potential denial-of-service attacks, FHEVM implements a metering system called Homomorphic Complexity Units ("HCU").To represent this complexity, we introduced the Homomorphic Complexity Unit ("HCU"). In Solidity, each FHE operation consumes a set amount of HCU based on the operational computational complexity for hardware computation. Since FHE transactions are symbolic, this helps preventing resource exhaustion outside of the blockchain.To do so, there is a contract named HCULimit, which monitors HCU consumption for each transaction and enforces two key limits:Sequential homomorphic operations depth limit per transaction: Controls HCU usage for operations that must be processed in order.Global homomorphic operations complexity per transaction: Controls HCU usage for operations that can be processed in parallel.If either limit is exceeded, the transaction will revert.HCU limitThe current devnet has an HCU limit of 20,000,000 per transaction and an HCU depth limit of 5,000,000 per transaction. If either HCU limit is exceeded, the transaction will revert.To resolve this, you must do one of the following:Refactor your code to reduce the number of FHE operations in your transaction.Split your FHE operations across multiple independent transactions.HCU costs for common operationsBoolean operations (ebool)and/or/xor26,000not30,000Unsigned integer operationsHCU increase with the bit-width of the encrypted integer type.

# How to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract? | Protocol

How to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract? | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHow to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract?This short guide will walk you through converting a standard Solidity contract into one that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) using FHEVM. This approach lets you develop your contract logic as usual, then adapt it to support encrypted computation for privacy.For this guide, we will focus on a voting contract example.1. Start with a Standard Solidity ContractBegin by writing your voting contract in Solidity as you normally would. Focus on implementing the core logic and functionality.
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SimpleVoting {
mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
uint64 public yesVotes;
uint64 public noVotes;
uint256 public voteDeadline;
function vote(bool support) public {
require(block.timestamp <= voteDeadline, "Too late to vote");
require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
if (support) {
yesVotes += 1;
} else {
noVotes += 1;
}
}
function getResults() public view returns (uint64, uint64) {
return (yesVotes, noVotes);
}
}2. Identify Sensitive Data and OperationsReview your contract and determine which variables, functions, or computations require privacy. In this example, the vote counts (yesVotes, noVotes) and individual votes should be encrypted.3. Integrate FHEVM and update your business logic accordingly.Replace standard data types and operations with their FHEVM equivalents for the identified sensitive parts. Use encrypted types and FHEVM library functions to perform computations on encrypted data.
import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import {SepoliaConfig} from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract EncryptedSimpleVoting is SepoliaConfig {
enum VotingStatus {
Open,
DecryptionInProgress,
ResultsDecrypted
}
mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
VotingStatus public status;
uint64 public decryptedYesVotes;
uint64 public decryptedNoVotes;
uint256 public voteDeadline;
euint64 private encryptedYesVotes;
euint64 private encryptedNoVotes;
constructor() {
encryptedYesVotes = FHE.asEuint64(0);
encryptedNoVotes = FHE.asEuint64(0);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedYesVotes);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedNoVotes);
}
function vote(externalEbool support, bytes memory inputProof) public {
require(block.timestamp <= voteDeadline, "Too late to vote");
require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
ebool isSupport = FHE.fromExternal(support, inputProof);
encryptedYesVotes = FHE.select(isSupport, FHE.add(encryptedYesVotes, 1), encryptedYesVotes);
encryptedNoVotes = FHE.select(isSupport, encryptedNoVotes, FHE.add(encryptedNoVotes, 1));
FHE.allowThis(encryptedYesVotes);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedNoVotes);
}
function requestVoteDecryption() public {
require(block.timestamp > voteDeadline, "Voting is not finished");
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](2);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(encryptedYesVotes);
cts[1] = FHE.toBytes32(encryptedNoVotes);
uint256 requestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.callbackDecryptVotes.selector);
status = VotingStatus.DecryptionInProgress;
}
function callbackDecryptVotes(uint256 requestId, uint64 yesVotes, uint64 noVotes, bytes[] memory signatures) public {
FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, signatures);
decryptedYesVotes = yesVotes;
decryptedNoVotes = noVotes;
status = VotingStatus.ResultsDecrypted;
}
function getResults() public view returns (uint64, uint64) {
require(status == VotingStatus.ResultsDecrypted, "Results were not decrypted");
return (
decryptedYesVotes,
decryptedNoVotes
);
}
}Adjust your contract’s code to accept and return encrypted data where necessary. This may involve changing function parameters and return types to work with ciphertexts instead of plaintext values, as shown above.The vote function now has two parameters: support and inputProof.The getResults can only be called after the decryption occurred. Otherwise, the decrypted results are not visible to anyone.However, it is far from being the main change. As this example illustrates, working with FHEVM often requires re-architecting the original logic to support privacy.In the updated code, the logic becomes async; results are hidden until a request (to the oracle) explicitely has to be made to decrypt publically the vote results.ConclusionAs this short guide showed, integrating with FHEVM not only requires integration with the FHEVM stack, it also requires refactoring your business logic to support mechanism to swift between encrypted and non-encrypted components of the logic.PreviousMigrate to v0.7Last updated 3 months ago

Each mode offers a trade-off between speed, encryption, and persistence.The Hardhat (In-Memory) default network: 🧪 Uses mock encryption. Ideal for regular tests, CI test coverage, and fast feedback during early contract development. No real encryption is used.The Hardhat Node (Local Server) network: 🧪 Uses mock encryption. Ideal when you need persistent state - for example, when testing frontend interactions, simulating user flows, or validating deployments in a realistic local environment. Still uses mock encryption.The Sepolia Testnet network: 🔐 Uses real encryption. Use this mode once your contract logic is stable and validated locally. This is the only mode that runs on the full FHEVM stack with real encrypted values. It simulates real-world production conditions but is slower and requires Sepolia ETH.Zama Testnet is not a blockchain itself. It is a protocol that enables you to run confidential smart contracts on existing blockchains (such as Ethereum, Base, and others) with the support of encrypted types. See the FHE on blockchain guide to learn more about the protocol architecture.Currently, Zama Protocol is available on the Sepolia Testnet. Support for additional chains will be added in the future.

4. Test the FHEVM contract | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick start tutorial4. Test the FHEVM contractIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to migrate a standard Hardhat test suite - from Counter.ts to its FHEVM-compatible version FHECounter.ts — and progressively enhance it to support Fully Homomorphic Encryption using Zama’s FHEVM library.Set up the FHEVM testing environment1Create a test script test/FHECounter.tsGo to your project's test directory <your-project-root-directory>/testFrom there, create a new file named FHECounter.ts and copy/paste the following Typescript skeleton code in it. { FHECounter, FHECounter__factory } from "../types";
import { FhevmType } from "@fhevm/hardhat-plugin";
import { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers, fhevm } from "hardhat";
type Signers = {
deployer: HardhatEthersSigner;

bob: HardhatEthersSigner;
};
async function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("FHECounter")) as FHECounter__factory;
const fheCounterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as FHECounter;
const fheCounterContractAddress = await fheCounterContract.getAddress();
return { fheCounterContract, fheCounterContractAddress };
}
describe("FHECounter", function () {

});What’s Different from Counter.ts?This test file is structurally similar to the original Counter.ts, but it uses the FHEVM-compatible smart contract FHECounter instead of the regular Counter.– For clarity, the Counter unit tests are included as comments, allowing you to better understand how each part is adapted during the migration to FHEVM.While the test logic remains the same, this version is now set up to support encrypted computations via the FHEVM library — enabling tests that manipulate confidential values directly on-chain.2Run the test test/FHECounter.tsFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testOutput:FHECounter

✔ should be deployed
1 passing (1ms)Great! Your Hardhat FHEVM test environment is properly setup.Test functionsNow everything is up and running, you can start testing your contract functions.1Call the contract getCount() view functionReplace the commented‐out test for the legacy Counter contract:
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// console.log(`Counter.getCount() === ${count}`);
// // Expect initial count to be 0 after deployment
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });with its FHEVM equivalent:("encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment", async function () {
const encryptedCount = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
// Expect initial count to be bytes32(0) after deployment,
// (meaning the encrypted count value is uninitialized)
expect(encryptedCount).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
});What’s different?– encryptedCount is no longer a plain TypeScript number. It is now a hexadecimal string representing a Solidity bytes32 value, known as an FHEVM handle. This handle points to an encrypted FHEVM primitive of type euint32, which internally represents an encrypted Solidity uint32 primitive type.encryptedCount is equal to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 which means that encryptedCount is uninitialized, and does not reference to any encrypted value at this point.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputCounter

✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
2 passing (7ms)2Setup the increment() function unit testWe’ll migrate the increment() unit test to FHEVM step by step. To start, let’s handle the value of the counter before the first increment. As explained above, the counter is initially a bytes32 value equal to zero, meaning the FHEVM euint32 variable is uninitialized.We’ll interpret this as if the underlying clear value is 0.Replace the commented‐out test for the legacy Counter contract:
// const countBeforeInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
// });with the following:("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});3Encrypt the increment() function argumentThe increment() function takes a single argument: the value by which the counter should be incremented. In the initial version of Counter.sol, this value is a clear uint32.We’ll switch to passing an encrypted value instead, using FHEVM externalEuint32 primitive type. This allows us to securely increment the counter without revealing the input value on-chain.We are using an externalEuint32 instead of a regular euint32. This tells the FHEVM that the encrypted uint32 was provided externally (e.g., by a user) and must be verified for integrity and authenticity before it can be used within the contract.Replace :("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});with the following:("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// Encrypt constant 1 as a euint32
const clearOne = 1;
const encryptedOne = await fhevm
.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address)
.add32(clearOne)
.encrypt();
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});fhevm.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address) creates an encrypted value that is bound to both the contract (fheCounterContractAddress) and the user (signers.alice.address). This means only Alice can use this encrypted value, and only within the FHECounter.sol contract at that specific address. It cannot be reused by another user or in a different contract, ensuring data confidentiality and binding context-specific encryption.4Call the increment() function with the encrypted argumentNow that we have an encrypted argument, we can call the increment() function with it.Below, you’ll notice that the updated increment() function now takes two arguments instead of one.This is because the FHEVM requires both:The externalEuint32 — the encrypted value itselfAn accompanying Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (inputProof) — which verifies that the encrypted input is securely bound to:the caller (Alice, the transaction signer), andthe target smart contract (where increment() is being executed)This ensures that the encrypted value cannot be reused in a different context or by a different user, preserving confidentiality and integrity.Replace :
// await tx.wait();with the following: tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();At this point the counter has been successfully incremented by 1 using a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). In the next step, we will retrieve the updated encrypted counter value and decrypt it locally. But before we move on, let’s quickly run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter

✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
3 passing (7ms)5Call the getCount() function and Decrypt the valueNow that the counter has been incremented using an encrypted input, it's time to read the updated encrypted value from the smart contract and decrypt it using the userDecryptEuint function provided by the FHEVM Hardhat Plugin.The userDecryptEuint function takes four parameters:FhevmType: The integer type of the FHE-encrypted value. In this case, we're using FhevmType.euint32 because the counter is a uint32.Encrypted handle: A 32-byte FHEVM handle representing the encrypted value you want to decrypt.Smart contract address: The address of the contract that has permission to access the encrypted handle.User signer: The signer (e.g., signers.alice) who has permission to access the handle.Note: Permissions to access the FHEVM handle are set on-chain using the FHE.allow() Solidity function (see FHECounter.sol).Replace :
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);with the following: encryptedCountAfterInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
const clearCountAfterInc = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCountAfterInc,
fheCounterContractAddress,
signers.alice,
);
expect(clearCountAfterInc).to.eq(clearCountBeforeInc + clearOne);Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter

✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
3 passing (7ms)6Call the contract decrement() functionSimilarly to the previous test, we’ll now call the decrement() function using an encrypted input.Replace :
// // First increment, count becomes 1
// let tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment();
// await tx.wait();
// // Then decrement, count goes back to 0
// tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });with the following:("decrement the counter by 1", async function () {
// Encrypt constant 1 as a euint32
const clearOne = 1;
const encryptedOne = await fhevm
.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address)
.add32(clearOne)
.encrypt();
// First increment by 1, count becomes 1
let tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();
// Then decrement by 1, count goes back to 0
tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();
const encryptedCountAfterDec = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
const clearCountAfterDec = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCountAfterDec,
fheCounterContractAddress,
signers.alice,
);
expect(clearCountAfterDec).to.eq(0);
});Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter

# 3. Turn it into FHEVM | Protocol

3. Turn it into FHEVM | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick start tutorial3. Turn it into FHEVMIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to take a basic Solidity smart contract and progressively upgrade it to support Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the FHEVM library by Zama.Starting with the plain Counter.sol contract that you build from the "Write a simple contract" tutorial, and step-by-step, you’ll learn how to:Replace standard types with encrypted equivalentsIntegrate zero-knowledge proof validationEnable encrypted on-chain computationGrant permissions for secure off-chain decryptionBy the end, you'll have a fully functional smart contract that supports FHE computation.Initiate the contract1Create the FHECounter.sol fileNavigate to your project’s contracts directory: <your-project-root-directory>/contractsFrom there, create a new file named FHECounter.sol, and copy the following Solidity code into it:
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
/// @title A simple counter contract
contract Counter {
uint32 private _count;
/// @notice Returns the current count
function getCount() external view returns (uint32) {
return _count;
}
/// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(uint32 value) external {
_count += value;
}
/// @notice Decrements the counter by a specific value
function decrement(uint32 value) external {
require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
_count -= value;
}
}This is a plain Counter contract that we’ll use as the starting point for adding FHEVM functionality. We will modify this contract step-by-step to progressively integrate FHEVM capabilities.2Turn Counter into FHECounterTo begin integrating FHEVM features into your contract, we first need to import the required FHEVM libraries.Replace the current header
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;With this updated header:
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import { FHE, euint32, externalEuint32 } from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";This imports:FHE — the core library to work with FHEVM encrypted typeseuint32 and externalEuint32 — encrypted uint32 types used in FHEVMSepoliaConfig — provides the FHEVM configuration for the Sepolia network.
Inheriting from it enables your contract to use the FHE libraryReplace the current contract declaration:@title A simple counter contract
contract Counter {With the updated declaration :@title A simple FHE counter contract
contract FHECounter is SepoliaConfig {This change:Renames the contract to FHECounterInherits from SepoliaConfig to enable FHEVM supportThis contract must inherit from the SepoliaConfig abstract contract; otherwise, it will not be able to execute any FHEVM-related functionality on Sepolia or Hardhat.From your project's root directory, run: hardhat compileGreat! Your smart contract is now compiled and ready to use FHEVM features.Apply FHE functions and types1Comment out the increment() and decrement() FunctionsBefore we move forward, let’s comment out the increment() and decrement() functions in FHECounter. We'll replace them later with updated versions that support FHE-encrypted operations./// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
// function increment(uint32 value) external {
// _count += value;
// }
/// @notice Decrements the counter by a specific value
// function decrement(uint32 value) external {
// require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
// _count -= value;
// }2Replace uint32 with the FHEVM euint32 TypeWe’ll now switch from the standard Solidity uint32 type to the encrypted FHEVM type euint32.This enables private, homomorphic computation on encrypted integers.Replace _count;and getCount() external view returns (uint32) {With :and getCount() external view returns (euint32) {3Replace increment(uint32 value) with the FHEVM version increment(externalEuint32 value)To support encrypted input, we will update the increment function to accept a value encrypted off-chain.Instead of using a uint32, the new version will accept an externalEuint32, which is an encrypted integer produced off-chain and sent to the smart contract.To ensure the validity of this encrypted value, we also include a second argument:inputProof, a bytes array containing a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPoK) that proves two things:The externalEuint32 was encrypted off-chain by the function caller (msg.sender)The externalEuint32 is bound to the contract (address(this)) and can only be processed by it.Replace/// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
// function increment(uint32 value) external {
// _count += value;
// }With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
// _count += value;
}4Convert externalEuint32 to euint32You cannot directly use externalEuint32 in FHE operations. To manipulate it with the FHEVM library, you first need to convert it into the native FHE type euint32.This conversion is done using:fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);This method verifies the zero-knowledge proof and returns a usable encrypted value within the contract.Replace@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
// _count += value;
}With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
// _count += value;
}5Convert _count += value into its FHEVM equivalentTo perform the update _count += value in a Fully Homomorphic way, we use the FHE.add() operator. This function allows us to compute the FHE sum of 2 encrypted integers.Replace@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
// _count += value;
}With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
}This FHE operation allows the smart contract to process encrypted values without ever decrypting them — a core feature of FHEVM that enables on-chain privacy.Grant FHE PermissionsThis step is critical! You must grant FHE permissions to both the contract and the caller to ensure the encrypted _count value can be decrypted off-chain by the caller. Without these 2 permissions, the caller will not be able to compute the clear result.To grant FHE permission we will call the FHE.allow() function.Replacefunction increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
}With :function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
FHE.allowThis(_count);
FHE.allow(_count, msg.sender);
}We grant two FHE permissions here — not just one. In the next part of the tutorial, you'll learn why both are necessary.Convert decrement() to its FHEVM equivalentJust like with the increment() migration, we’ll now convert the decrement() function to its FHEVM-compatible version.Replace :function decrement(uint32 value) external {
require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
_count -= value;
}with the following :/// @dev This example omits overflow/underflow checks for simplicity and readability.
/// In a production contract, proper range checks should be implemented.
function decrement(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 encryptedEuint32 = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.sub(_count, encryptedEuint32);
FHE.allowThis(_count);
FHE.allow(_count, msg.sender);
}The increment() and decrement() functions do not perform any overflow or underflow checks.Compile FHECounter.solFrom your project's root directory, run:Congratulations! Your smart contract is now fully FHEVM-compatible.Now you should have the following files in your project:contracts/FHECounter.sol — your Solidity smart FHEVM contracttest/FHECounter.ts — your FHEVM Hardhat test suite written in TypeScriptIn the next tutorial, we’ll move on to the TypeScript integration, where you’ll learn how to interact with your newly upgraded FHEVM contract in a test suite.Previous2.

Your Hardhat test environment is properly setup.3Set up the test signersBefore interacting with smart contracts in Hardhat tests, we need to initialize signers.In the context of Ethereum development, a signer represents an entity (usually a wallet) that can send transactions and sign messages. In Hardhat, ethers.getSigners() returns a list of pre-funded test accounts.We’ll define three named signers for convenience:owner — the deployer of the contractalice and bob — additional simulated usersReplace the contents of test/Counter.ts with the following: { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";

✔ should work
1 passing (2ms)4Set up testing instanceNow that we have our signers set up, we can deploy the smart contract.To ensure isolated and deterministic tests, we should deploy a fresh instance of Counter.sol before each test. This avoids any side effects from previous tests.The standard approach is to define a deployFixture() function that handles contract deployment. function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("Counter")) as Counter__factory;
const counterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as Counter;
const counterContractAddress = await counterContract.getAddress();
return { counterContract, counterContractAddress };
}To run this setup before each test case, call deployFixture() inside a beforeEach block:(async () => {

# Configuration | Protocol

Configuration | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageConfigurationThis document explains how to enable encrypted computations in your smart contract by setting up the fhevm environment. Learn how to integrate essential libraries, configure encryption, and add secure computation logic to your contracts.Core configuration setupTo utilize encrypted computations in Solidity contracts, you must configure the FHE library and Oracle addresses. The fhevm package simplifies this process with prebuilt configuration contracts, allowing you to focus on developing your contract’s logic without handling the underlying cryptographic setup.This library and its associated contracts provide a standardized way to configure and interact with Zama's FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) infrastructure on different Ethereum networks. It supplies the necessary contract addresses for Zama's FHEVM components (ACL, FHEVMExecutor, KMSVerifier, InputVerifier) and the decryption oracle, enabling seamless integration for Solidity contracts that require FHEVM support.Key components configured automaticallyFHE library: Sets up encryption parameters and cryptographic keys.Oracle: Manages secure cryptographic operations such as public decryption.Network-specific settings: Adapts to local testing, testnets (Sepolia for example), or mainnet deployment.By inheriting these configuration contracts, you ensure seamless initialization and functionality across environments.ZamaConfig.solThe ZamaConfig library exposes functions to retrieve FHEVM configuration structs and oracle addresses for supported networks (currently only the Sepolia testnet).Under the hood, this library encapsulates the network-specific addresses of Zama's FHEVM infrastructure into a single struct (FHEVMConfigStruct).SepoliaConfigThe SepoliaConfig contract is designed to be inherited by a user contract. The constructor automatically sets up the FHEVM coprocessor and decryption oracle using the configuration provided by the library for the respective network. When a contract inherits from SepoliaConfig, the constructor calls FHE.setCoprocessor and FHE.setDecryptionOracle with the appropriate addresses. This ensures that the inheriting contract is automatically wired to the correct FHEVM contracts and oracle for the target network, abstracting away manual address management and reducing the risk of misconfiguration.Example: using Sepolia configurationpragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract MyERC20 is SepoliaConfig {
constructor() {
// Additional initialization logic if needed
}
}Using isInitializedThe isInitialized utility function checks whether an encrypted variable has been properly initialized, preventing unexpected behavior due to uninitialized values.Function signaturePurposeEnsures encrypted variables are initialized before use.Prevents potential logic errors in contract execution.Example: Initialization Check for Encrypted CounterSummaryBy leveraging prebuilt a configuration contract like SepoliaConfig in ZamaConfig.sol, you can efficiently set up your smart contract for encrypted computations. These tools abstract the complexity of cryptographic initialization, allowing you to focus on building secure, confidential smart contracts.Previous4.

# Access Control List | Protocol

Access Control List | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListThis document describes the Access Control List (ACL) system in FHEVM, a core feature that governs access to encrypted data. The ACL ensures that only authorized accounts or contracts can interact with specific ciphertexts, preserving confidentiality while enabling composable smart contracts. This overview provides a high-level understanding of what the ACL is, why it's essential, and how it works.What is the ACL?The ACL is a permission management system designed to control who can access, compute on, or decrypt encrypted values in fhevm. By defining and enforcing these permissions, the ACL ensures that encrypted data remains secure while still being usable within authorized contexts.Why is the ACL important?Encrypted data in FHEVM is entirely confidential, meaning that without proper access control, even the contract holding the ciphertext cannot interact with it. The ACL enables:Granular permissions: Define specific access rules for individual accounts or contracts.Secure computations: Ensure that only authorized entities can manipulate or decrypt encrypted data.Gas efficiency: Optimize permissions using transient access for temporary needs, reducing storage and gas costs.How does the ACL work?Types of accessPermanent allowance:Configured using FHE.allow(ciphertext, address).Grants long-term access to the ciphertext for a specific address.Stored in a dedicated contract for persistent storage.Transient allowance:Configured using FHE.allowTransient(ciphertext, address).Grants access to the ciphertext only for the duration of the current transaction.Stored in transient storage, reducing gas costs.Ideal for temporary operations like passing ciphertexts to external functions.Permanent public allowance:Configured using FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext).Grants long-term access to the ciphertext for any user.Stored in a dedicated contract for persistent storage.Syntactic sugar:FHE.allowThis(ciphertext) is shorthand for FHE.allow(ciphertext, address(this)). It authorizes the current contract to reuse a ciphertext handle in future transactions.Transient vs. permanent allowanceTransientTemporary access during a transaction.Transient storage (EIP-1153)Calling external functions or computations with ciphertexts. Use when wanting to save on gas costs.PermanentLong-term access across multiple transactions.Dedicated contract storagePersistent ciphertexts for contracts or users requiring ongoing access.Granting and verifying accessGranting accessDevelopers can use functions like allow, allowThis, and allowTransient to grant permissions:allow: Grants permanent access to an address.allowThis: Grants the current contract access to manipulate the ciphertext.allowTransient: Grants temporary access to an address for the current transaction.Verifying accessTo check if an entity has permission to access a ciphertext, use functions like isAllowed or isSenderAllowed:isAllowed: Verifies if a specific address has permission.isSenderAllowed: Simplifies checks for the current transaction sender.Practical uses of the ACLConfidential parameters: Pass encrypted values securely between contracts, ensuring only authorized entities can access them.Secure state management: Store encrypted state variables while controlling who can modify or read them.Privacy-preserving computations: Enable computations on encrypted data with confidence that permissions are enforced.For a detailed explanation of the ACL's functionality, including code examples and advanced configurations, see ACL examples.PreviousEncrypted inputsNextACL examplesLast updated 1 month ago

# Encrypted inputs | Protocol

Encrypted inputs | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageEncrypted inputsThis document introduces the concept of encrypted inputs in the FHEVM, explaining their role, structure, validation process, and how developers can integrate them into smart contracts and applications.Encrypted inputs are a core feature of FHEVM, enabling users to push encrypted data onto the blockchain while ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.What are encrypted inputs?Encrypted inputs are data values submitted by users in ciphertext form. These inputs allow sensitive information to remain confidential while still being processed by smart contracts. They are accompanied by Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPoKs) to ensure the validity of the encrypted data without revealing the plaintext.Key characteristics of encrypted inputs:Confidentiality: Data is encrypted using the public FHE key, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt or process the values.Validation via ZKPoKs: Each encrypted input is accompanied by a proof verifying that the user knows the plaintext value of the ciphertext, preventing replay attacks or misuse.Efficient packing: All inputs for a transaction are packed into a single ciphertext in a user-defined order, optimizing the size and generation of the zero-knowledge proof.Parameters in encrypted functionsWhen a function in a smart contract is called, it may accept two types of parameters for encrypted inputs:externalEbool, externalEaddress,externalEuintXX: Refers to the index of the encrypted parameter within the proof, representing a specific encrypted input handle.bytes: Contains the ciphertext and the associated zero-knowledge proof used for validation.Here’s an example of a Solidity function accepting multiple encrypted parameters: exampleFunction(
externalEbool param1,
externalEuint64 param2,
externalEuint8 param3,
bytes calldata inputProof
) public {
// Function logic here
}In this example, param1, param2, and param3 are encrypted inputs for ebool, euint64, and euint8 while inputProof contains the corresponding ZKPoK to validate their authenticity.Input Generation using HardhatIn the below example, we use Alice's address to create the encrypted inputs and submits the transaction.
const input = fhevm.createEncryptedInput(contract.address, signers.alice.address);
input.addBool(canTransfer); // at index 0
input.add64(transferAmount); // at index 1
input.add8(transferType); // at index 2
const encryptedInput = await input.encrypt();
const externalEboolParam1 = encryptedInput.handles[0];
const externalEuint64Param2 = encryptedInput.handles[1];
const externalEuint8Param3 = encryptedInput.handles[2];
const inputProof = encryptedInput.inputProof;
tx = await myContract
.connect(signers.alice)
[
"exampleFunction(bytes32,bytes32,bytes32,bytes)"
](signers.bob.address, externalEboolParam1, externalEuint64Param2, externalEuint8Param3, inputProof);
await tx.wait();Input OrderDevelopers are free to design the function parameters in any order. There is no required correspondence between the order in which encrypted inputs are constructed in TypeScript and the order of arguments in the Solidity function.Validating encrypted inputsSmart contracts process encrypted inputs by verifying them against the associated zero-knowledge proof. This is done using the FHE.asEuintXX, FHE.asEbool, or FHE.asEaddress functions, which validate the input and convert it into the appropriate encrypted type.Example validationThis example demonstrates a function that performs multiple encrypted operations, such as updating a user's encrypted balance and toggling an encrypted boolean flag: // Validate and convert the encrypted inputs
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
ebool toggleFlag = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedToggle, inputProof);
// Update the user's encrypted balance
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], amount);
// Toggle the user's encrypted flag
userFlags[msg.sender] = FHE.not(toggleFlag);
// FHE permissions and function logic here
...
}
// Function to retrieve a user's encrypted balance
function getEncryptedBalance() public view returns (euint64) {
return balances[msg.sender];
}
// Function to retrieve a user's encrypted flag
function getEncryptedFlag() public view returns (ebool) {
return userFlags[msg.sender];
}Example validation in the ConfidentialERC20.sol smart contractHere’s an example of a smart contract function that verifies an encrypted input before proceeding: address to,
externalEuint64 encryptedAmount,
bytes calldata inputProof
) public {
// Verify the provided encrypted amount and convert it into an encrypted uint64
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
// Function logic here, such as transferring funds
...
}How validation worksInput verification:
The FHE.fromExternal function ensures that the input is a valid ciphertext with a corresponding ZKPoK.Type conversion:
The function transforms externalEbool, externalEaddress, externalEuintXX into the appropriate encrypted type (ebool, eaddress, euintXX) for further operations within the contract.Best PracticesInput packing: Minimize the size and complexity of zero-knowledge proofs by packing all encrypted inputs into a single ciphertext.Frontend encryption: Always encrypt inputs using the FHE public key on the client side to ensure data confidentiality.Proof management: Ensure that the correct zero-knowledge proof is associated with each encrypted input to avoid validation errors.Encrypted inputs and their validation form the backbone of secure and private interactions in the FHEVM. By leveraging these tools, developers can create robust, privacy-preserving smart contracts without compromising functionality or scalability.PreviousGenerate random numbersNextAccess Control ListLast updated 1 month ago

# Operations on encrypted types | Protocol

Operations on encrypted types | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesThis document outlines the operations supported on encrypted types in the FHE library, enabling arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, and more on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) ciphertexts.Arithmetic operationsThe following arithmetic operations are supported for encrypted integers (euintX):AddFHE.add+BinarySubtractFHE.sub-BinaryMultiplyFHE.mul*BinaryDivide (plaintext divisor)FHE.divBinaryReminder (plaintext divisor)FHE.remBinaryNegationFHE.neg-UnaryMinFHE.minBinaryMaxFHE.maxBinaryDivision (FHE.div) and remainder (FHE.rem) operations are currently supported only with plaintext divisors.Bitwise operationsThe FHE library also supports bitwise operations, including shifts and rotations:Bitwise ANDFHE.and&BinaryBitwise ORFHE.or|BinaryBitwise XORFHE.xor^BinaryBitwise NOTFHE.not~UnaryShift RightFHE.shrBinaryShift LeftFHE.shlBinaryRotate RightFHE.rotrBinaryRotate LeftFHE.rotlBinaryThe shift operators FHE.shr and FHE.shl can take any encrypted type euintX as a first operand and either a uint8or a euint8 as a second operand, however the second operand will always be computed modulo the number of bits of the first operand. For example, FHE.shr(euint64 x, 70) is equivalent to FHE.shr(euint64 x, 6) because 70 % 64 = 6. This differs from the classical shift operators in Solidity, where there is no intermediate modulo operation, so for instance any uint64 shifted right via >> would give a null result.Comparison operationsEncrypted integers can be compared using the following functions:EqualFHE.eqBinaryNot equalFHE.neBinaryGreater than or equalFHE.geBinaryGreater thanFHE.gtBinaryLess than or equalFHE.leBinaryLess thanFHE.ltBinaryTernary operationThe FHE.select function is a ternary operation that selects one of two encrypted values based on an encrypted condition:SelectFHE.selectTernaryRandom operationsYou can generate cryptographically secure random numbers fully on-chain:NameFunction NameSymbolTypeRandom Unsigned IntegerFHE.randEuintX()RandomFor more details, refer to the Random Encrypted Numbers document.Best PracticesHere are some best practices to follow when using encrypted operations in your smart contracts:Use the appropriate encrypted type sizeChoose the smallest encrypted type that can accommodate your data to optimize gas costs. For example, use euint8 for small numbers (0-255) rather than euint256.❌ Avoid using oversized types:euint64 age = FHE.asEuint128(25); // age will never exceed 255
euint64 percentage = FHE.asEuint128(75); // percentage is 0-100✅ Instead, use the smallest appropriate type:euint8 age = FHE.asEuint8(25); // age fits in 8 bits
euint8 percentage = FHE.asEuint8(75); // percentage fits in 8 bitsUse scalar operands when possible to save gasSome FHE operators exist in two versions: one where all operands are ciphertexts handles, and another where one of the operands is an unencrypted scalar. Whenever possible, use the scalar operand version, as this will save a lot of gas.❌ For example, this snippet cost way more in gas:...
x = FHE.add(x,FHE.asEuint(42));✅ Than this one:// ...
x = FHE.add(x,42);Despite both leading to the same encrypted result!Beware of overflows of FHE arithmetic operatorsFHE arithmetic operators can overflow. Do not forget to take into account such a possibility when implementing FHEVM smart contracts.❌ For example, if you wanted to create a mint function for an encrypted ERC20 token with an encrypted totalSupply state variable, this code is vulnerable to overflows: euint32 mintedAmount = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
totalSupply = FHE.add(totalSupply, mintedAmount);
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], mintedAmount);
FHE.allowThis(balances[msg.sender]);
FHE.allow(balances[msg.sender], msg.sender);
}✅ But you can fix this issue by using FHE.select to cancel the mint in case of an overflow: euint32 mintedAmount = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
euint32 tempTotalSupply = FHE.add(totalSupply, mintedAmount);
ebool isOverflow = FHE.lt(tempTotalSupply, totalSupply);
totalSupply = FHE.select(isOverflow, totalSupply, tempTotalSupply);
euint32 tempBalanceOf = FHE.add(balances[msg.sender], mintedAmount);
balances[msg.sender] = FHE.select(isOverflow, balances[msg.sender], tempBalanceOf);
FHE.allowThis(balances[msg.sender]);
FHE.allow(balances[msg.sender], msg.sender);
}Notice that we did not check separately the overflow on balances[msg.sender] but only on totalSupply variable, because totalSupply is the sum of the balances of all the users, so balances[msg.sender] could never overflow if totalSupply did not.PreviousSupported typesNextCasting and trivial encryptionLast updated 1 month ago

# Decryption | Protocol

Decryption | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageDecryptionThis section explains how to handle decryption in fhevm. Decryption allows plaintext data to be accessed when required for contract logic or user presentation, ensuring confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.Decryption is essential in two primary cases:Smart contract logic: A contract requires plaintext values for computations or decision-making.User interaction: Plaintext data needs to be revealed to all users, such as revealing the decision of the vote.OverviewDecryption in FHEVM is an asynchronous process that involves the Relayer and Key Management System (KMS). Here’s an example of how to safely request decryption in a contract.Example: asynchronous decryption in a contract solidity ^0.8.24;
import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract TestAsyncDecrypt is SepoliaConfig {
ebool xBool;
bool public yBool;
bool isDecryptionPending;
uint256 latestRequestId;
constructor() {
xBool = FHE.asEbool(true);
FHE.allowThis(xBool);
}
function requestBool() public {
require(!isDecryptionPending, "Decryption is in progress");
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](1);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(xBool);
uint256 latestRequestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.myCustomCallback.selector);
/// @dev This prevents sending multiple requests before the first callback was sent.
isDecryptionPending = true;
}
function myCustomCallback(uint256 requestId, bytes memory cleartexts, bytes memory decryptionProof) public returns (bool) {
/// @dev This check is used to verify that the request id is the expected one.
require(requestId == latestRequestId, "Invalid requestId");
FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, cleartexts, decryptionProof);
(bool decryptedInput) = abi.decode(cleartexts, (bool));
yBool = decryptedInput;
isDecryptionPending = false;
return yBool;
}
}Decryption in depthThis document provides a detailed guide on implementing decryption in your smart contracts using the DecryptionOracle in fhevm. It covers the setup, usage of the FHE.requestDecryption function, and testing with Hardhat.DecryptionOracle setupThe DecryptionOracle is pre-deployed on the FHEVM testnet. It uses a default relayer account specified in the .env file.Anyone can fulfill decryption requests but it is essential to add signature verification (and to include a logic to invalidate the replay of decryption requests). The role of the DecryptionOracle contract is to independently verify the KMS signature during execution. This ensures that the relayers cannot manipulate or send fraudulent decryption results, even if compromised.There are two functions to consider: requestDecryption and checkSignatures.FHE.requestDecryption functionYou can call the function FHE.requestDecryption as such: bytes32[] calldata ctsHandles,
bytes4 callbackSelector
) external payable returns (uint256 requestId);Function argumentsThe first argument, ctsHandles, should be an array of ciphertexts handles which could be of different types, i.e uint256 values coming from unwrapping handles of type either ebool, euint8, euint16, euint32, euint64 or eaddress.ctsHandles is the array of ciphertexts that are requested to be decrypted. The relayer will send the corresponding ciphertexts to the KMS for decryption before fulfilling the request.callbackSelector is the function selector of the callback function, which will be called once the relayer fulfils the decryption request.cleartexts is the bytes array corresponding to the ABI encoding of all requested decrypted values. Each of these decrypted values' type should be a native Solidity type corresponding to the original ciphertext type, following this table of conventions:eboolbooleuint8uint8euint16uint16euint32uint32euint64uint64euint128uint128euint256uint256eaddressaddressHere callbackName is a custom name given by the developer to the callback function, requestID will be the request id of the decryption (could be commented if not needed in the logic, but must be present) and cleartexts is an ABI encoded byte array of the results of the decryption of the ct array values, i.e their number should be the size of the ct array. decryptionProof is a byte array containing the KMS signatures and extra data.msgValue is the value in native tokens to be sent to the calling contract during fulfillment, i.e when the callback will be called with the results of decryption.Notice that the callback should always verify the signatures and implement a replay protection mechanism (see below).FHE.checkSignatures functionYou can call the function FHE.checkSignatures as such:Function argumentsrequestID, is the value that was returned in the requestDecryption function.cleartexts, is an ABI encoding of the decrypted values associated to the handles (using abi.encode). This can contain one or multiple values, depending on the number of handles requested in the requestDecryption function. Each of these values' type must match the type of the corresponding handle.decryptionProof, is a byte array containing the KMS signatures and extra data.This function reverts if the signatures are invalid.PreviousError handlingNextHardhat pluginLast updated 1 month ago

# Supported types | Protocol

Supported types | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageSupported typesThis document introduces the encrypted integer types provided by the FHE library in FHEVM and explains their usage, including casting, state variable declarations, and type-specific considerations.IntroductionThe FHE library offers a robust type system with encrypted integer types, enabling secure computations on confidential data in smart contracts. These encrypted types are validated both at compile time and runtime to ensure correctness and security.Key features of encrypted typesEncrypted integers function similarly to Solidity’s native integer types, but they operate on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) ciphertexts.Arithmetic operations on e(u)int types are unchecked, meaning they wrap around on overflow. This design choice ensures confidentiality by avoiding the leakage of information through error detection.Future versions of the FHE library will support encrypted integers with overflow checking, but with the trade-off of exposing limited information about the operands.Encrypted integers with overflow checking will soon be available in the FHE library. These will allow reversible arithmetic operations but may reveal some information about the input values.Encrypted integers in FHEVM are represented as FHE ciphertexts, abstracted using ciphertext handles. These types, prefixed with e (for example, euint64) act as secure wrappers over the ciphertext handles.List of encrypted typesThe FHE library currently supports the following encrypted types:Ebool2and, or, xor, eq, ne, not, select, randEuint88add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint1616add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint3232add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint6464add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint128128add, sub, mul, div, rem, and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, min, max, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedEuint160160Eaddress (eq, ne, select)Euint256256and, or, xor, shl, shr, rotl, rotr, eq, ne, neg, not, select, rand, randBoundedDivision (div) and remainder (rem) operations are only supported when the right-hand side (rhs) operand is a plaintext (non-encrypted) value. Attempting to use an encrypted value as rhs will result in a panic. This restriction ensures correct and secure computation within the current framework.Higher-precision integer types are available in the TFHE-rs library and can be added to fhevm as needed.PreviousContract addressesNextOperations on encrypted typesLast updated 1 month ago

# Casting and trivial encryption | Protocol

Casting and trivial encryption | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesCasting and trivial encryptionThis documentation covers the asEbool, asEuintXX, and asEaddress operations provided by the FHE library for working with encrypted data in the FHEVM. These operations are essential for converting between plaintext and encrypted types, as well as handling encrypted inputs.The operations can be categorized into two main use cases:Trivial encryption: Converting plaintext values to encrypted typesType casting: Converting between different encrypted types1. Trivial encryptionTrivial encryption simply put is a plain text in a format of a ciphertext.OverviewTrivial encryption is the process of converting plaintext values into encrypted types (ciphertexts) compatible with FHE operators. Although the data is in ciphertext format, it remains publicly visible on-chain, making it useful for operations between public and private values.This type of casting involves converting plaintext (unencrypted) values into their encrypted equivalents, such as:bool → ebooluint → euintXXaddress → eaddressWhen doing trivial encryption, the data is made compatible with FHE operations but remains publicly visible on-chain unless explicitly encrypted.Example= FHE.asEuint64(7262); // Trivial encrypt a uint64
ebool valueBool = FHE.asEbool(true); // Trivial encrypt a boolean2. Casting between encrypted typesThis type of casting is used to reinterpret or convert one encrypted type into another. For example:euint32 → euint64Casting between encrypted types is often required when working with operations that demand specific sizes or precisions.Important: When casting between encrypted types:Casting from smaller types to larger types (e.g. euint32 → euint64) preserves all informationCasting from larger types to smaller types (e.g. euint64 → euint32) will truncate and lose informationThe table below summarizes the available casting functions:euintXeuintXFHE.asEuintXXebooleuintXFHE.asEuintXXeuintXeboolFHE.asEboolXXCasting between encrypted types is efficient and often necessary when handling data with differing precision requirements.Workflow for encrypted typeseuint32 value32 = FHE.asEuint32(value64); // Cast to euint32

# Generate random numbers | Protocol

Generate random numbers | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperations on encrypted typesGenerate random numbersThis document explains how to generate cryptographically secure random encrypted numbers fully on-chain using the FHE library in fhevm. These numbers are encrypted and remain confidential, enabling privacy-preserving smart contract logic.Key notes on random number generationOn-chain execution: Random number generation must be executed during a transaction, as it requires the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state to be updated on-chain. This operation cannot be performed using the eth_call RPC method.Cryptographic security: The generated random numbers are cryptographically secure and encrypted, ensuring privacy and unpredictability.Random number generation must be performed during transactions, as it requires the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state to be mutated on-chain. Therefore, it cannot be executed using the eth_call RPC method.Basic usageThe FHE library allows you to generate random encrypted numbers of various bit sizes. Below is a list of supported types and their usage:
ebool rb = FHE.randEbool(); // Random encrypted boolean
euint8 r8 = FHE.randEuint8(); // Random 8-bit number
euint16 r16 = FHE.randEuint16(); // Random 16-bit number
euint32 r32 = FHE.randEuint32(); // Random 32-bit number
euint64 r64 = FHE.randEuint64(); // Random 64-bit number
euint128 r128 = FHE.randEuint128(); // Random 128-bit number
euint256 r256 = FHE.randEuint256(); // Random 256-bit numberExample: Random Boolean return FHE.randEbool();
}Bounded random numbersTo generate random numbers within a specific range, you can specify an upper bound. The random number will be in the range [0, upperBound - 1].euint8 r8 = FHE.randEuint8(100); // Random number between 0-99
euint16 r16 = FHE.randEuint16(1000); // Random number between 0-999
euint32 r32 = FHE.randEuint32(1000000); // Random number between 0-999999Example: Random number with upper bound return FHE.randEuint16(upperBound);
}Security ConsiderationsCryptographic security:
The random numbers are generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) and remain encrypted until explicitly decrypted.Gas consumption:
Each call to a random number generation function consumes gas. Developers should optimize the use of these functions, especially in gas-sensitive contracts.Privacy guarantee:
Random values are fully encrypted, ensuring they cannot be accessed or predicted by unauthorized parties.PreviousCasting and trivial encryptionNextEncrypted inputsLast updated 1 month ago

# Branching | Protocol

Branching | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsBranchingThis document explains how to implement conditional logic (if/else branching) when working with encrypted values in FHEVM. Unlike typical Solidity programming, working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) requires specialized methods to handle conditions on encrypted data.This document covers encrypted branching and how to move from an encrypted condition to a non-encrypted business logic in your smart contract.What is confidential branching?In FHEVM, when you perform comparison operations, the result is an encrypted boolean (ebool). Since encrypted booleans do not support standard boolean operations like if statements or logical operators, conditional logic must be implemented using specialized methods.To facilitate conditional assignments, FHEVM provides the FHE.select function, which acts as a ternary operator for encrypted values.Using FHE.select for conditional logicThe FHE.select function enables branching logic by selecting one of two encrypted values based on an encrypted condition (ebool). It works as follows:select(condition, valueIfTrue, valueIfFalse);condition: An encrypted boolean (ebool) resulting from a comparison.valueIfTrue: The encrypted value to return if the condition is true.valueIfFalse: The encrypted value to return if the condition is false.Example: Auction Bidding LogicHere's an example of using conditional logic to update the highest winning number in a guessing game: bid(externalEuint64 encryptedValue, bytes calldata inputProof) external onlyBeforeEnd {
// Convert the encrypted input to an encrypted 64-bit integer
euint64 bid = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedValue, inputProof);
// Compare the current highest bid with the new bid
ebool isAbove = FHE.lt(highestBid, bid);
// Update the highest bid if the new bid is greater
highestBid = FHE.select(isAbove, bid, highestBid);
// Allow the contract to use the updated highest bid ciphertext
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
}This is a simplified example to demonstrate the functionality.How Does It Work?Comparison:The FHE.lt function compares highestBid and bid, returning an ebool (isAbove) that indicates whether the new bid is higher.Selection:The FHE.select function updates highestBid to either the new bid or the previous highest bid, based on the encrypted condition isAbove.Permission Handling:After updating highestBid, the contract reauthorizes itself to manipulate the updated ciphertext using FHE.allowThis.Key ConsiderationsValue change behavior: Each time FHE.select assigns a value, a new ciphertext is created, even if the underlying plaintext value remains unchanged. This behavior is inherent to FHE and ensures data confidentiality, but developers should account for it when designing their smart contracts.Gas consumption: Using FHE.select and other encrypted operations incurs additional gas costs compared to traditional Solidity logic. Optimize your code to minimize unnecessary operations.Access control: Always use appropriate ACL functions (e.g., FHE.allowThis, FHE.allow) to ensure the updated ciphertexts are authorized for use in future computations or transactions.How to branch to a non-confidential path?So far, this section only covered how to do branching using encrypted variables. However, there may be many cases where the "public" contract logic will depend on the outcome from a encrypted path.To do so, there are only one way to branch from an encrypted path to a non-encrypted path: it requires a public decryption using the oracle. Hence, any contract logic that requires moving from an encrypted input to a non-encrypted path always requires an async contract logic.Example: Auction Bidding Logic: Item ReleaseGoing back to our previous example with the auction bidding logic. Let's assume that the winner of the auction can receive some prize, which is not confidential.eaddress internal highestBidder;
euint64 internal highestBid;
function bid(externalEuint64 encryptedValue, bytes calldata inputProof) external onlyBeforeEnd {
// Convert the encrypted input to an encrypted 64-bit integer
euint64 bid = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedValue, inputProof);
// Compare the current highest bid with the new bid
ebool isAbove = FHE.lt(highestBid, bid);
// Update the highest bid if the new bid is greater
highestBid = FHE.select(isAbove, bid, highestBid);
// Update the highest bidder address if the new bid is greater
highestBidder = FHE.select(isAbove, FHE.asEaddress(msg.sender), currentBidder));
// Allow the contract to use the highest bidder address
FHE.allowThis(highestBidder);
// Allow the contract to use the updated highest bid ciphertext
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
}
function revealWinner() external onlyAfterEnd {
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](2);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(highestBidder);
uint256 requestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.transferPrize.selector);
}
function transferPrize(uint256 requestId, address auctionWinner, bytes memory signatures) external {
require(!isPrizeDistributed, "Prize has already been distributed");
FHE.verifySignatures(requestId, signatures)
isPrizeDistributed = true;
// Business logic to transfer the prize to the auction winner
}This is a simplified example to demonstrate the functionality.As you can see the in the above example, the path to move from an encrypted condition to a decrypted business logic must be async and requires calling the decryption oracle contract to reveal the result of the logic using encrypted variables.SummaryFHE.select is a powerful tool for conditional logic on encrypted values.Encrypted booleans (ebool) and values maintain confidentiality, enabling privacy-preserving logic.Developers should account for gas costs and ciphertext behavior when designing conditional operations.PreviousLogicsNextDealing with branches and conditionsLast updated 1 month ago

# Error handling | Protocol

# Error handling | Protocol

Error handling | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsError handlingThis document explains how to handle errors effectively in FHEVM smart contracts. Since transactions involving encrypted data do not automatically revert when conditions are not met, developers need alternative mechanisms to communicate errors to users.Challenges in error handlingIn the context of encrypted data:No automatic reversion: Transactions do not revert if a condition fails, making it challenging to notify users of issues like insufficient funds or invalid inputs.Limited feedback: Encrypted computations lack direct mechanisms for exposing failure reasons while maintaining confidentiality.Recommended approach: Error logging with a handlerTo address these challenges, implement an error handler that records the most recent error for each user. This allows dApps or frontends to query error states and provide appropriate feedback to users.Example implementationThe following contract snippet demonstrates how to implement and use an error handler: LastError {
euint8 error; // Encrypted error code
uint timestamp; // Timestamp of the error
}
// Define error codes
euint8 internal NO_ERROR;
euint8 internal NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS;
constructor() {
NO_ERROR = FHE.asEuint8(0); // Code 0: No error
NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS = FHE.asEuint8(1); // Code 1: Insufficient funds
}
// Store the last error for each address
mapping(address => LastError) private _lastErrors;
// Event to notify about an error state change
event ErrorChanged(address indexed user);
/**
* @dev Set the last error for a specific address.
* @param error Encrypted error code.
* @param addr Address of the user.
*/
function setLastError(euint8 error, address addr) private {
_lastErrors[addr] = LastError(error, block.timestamp);
emit ErrorChanged(addr);
}
/**
* @dev Internal transfer function with error handling.
* @param from Sender's address.
* @param to Recipient's address.
* @param amount Encrypted transfer amount.
*/
function _transfer(address from, address to, euint32 amount) internal {
// Check if the sender has enough balance to transfer
ebool canTransfer = FHE.le(amount, balances[from]);
// Log the error state: NO_ERROR or NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS
setLastError(FHE.select(canTransfer, NO_ERROR, NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS), msg.sender);
// Perform the transfer operation conditionally
balances[to] = FHE.add(balances[to], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint32(0)));
FHE.allowThis(balances[to]);
FHE.allow(balances[to], to);
balances[from] = FHE.sub(balances[from], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint32(0)));
FHE.allowThis(balances[from]);
FHE.allow(balances[from], from);
}How It WorksDefine error codes:NO_ERROR: Indicates a successful operation.NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS: Indicates insufficient balance for a transfer.Record errors:Use the setLastError function to log the latest error for a specific address along with the current timestamp.Emit the ErrorChanged event to notify external systems (e.g., dApps) about the error state change.Conditional updates:Use the FHE.select function to update balances and log errors based on the transfer condition (canTransfer).Frontend integration:The dApp can query _lastErrors for a user’s most recent error and display appropriate feedback, such as "Insufficient funds" or "Transaction successful."Example error queryThe frontend or another contract can query the _lastErrors mapping to retrieve error details: * @dev Get the last error for a specific address.
* @param user Address of the user.
* @return error Encrypted error code.
* @return timestamp Timestamp of the error.
*/
function getLastError(address user) public view returns (euint8 error, uint timestamp) {
LastError memory lastError = _lastErrors[user];
return (lastError.error, lastError.timestamp);
}Benefits of this approachUser feedback:Provides actionable error messages without compromising the confidentiality of encrypted computations.Scalable error tracking:Logs errors per user, making it easy to identify and debug specific issues.Event-driven notifications:Enables frontends to react to errors in real time via the ErrorChanged event.By implementing error handlers as demonstrated, developers can ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining the privacy and integrity of encrypted data operations.PreviousDealing with branches and conditionsNextDecryptionLast updated 1 month ago

# Dealing with branches and conditions | Protocol

Dealing with branches and conditions | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageLogicsDealing with branches and conditionsThis document explains how to handle branches, loops or conditions when working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically when the condition / index is encrypted.Breaking a loop❌ In FHE, it is not possible to break a loop based on an encrypted condition. For example, this would not work:= FHE.asEuint(6); // Could be a value between 0 and 10
euint8 x = FHE.asEuint(0);
// some code
while(FHE.lt(x, maxValue)){
x = FHE.add(x, 2);
}If your code logic requires looping on an encrypted boolean condition, we highly suggest to try to replace it by a finite loop with an appropriate constant maximum number of steps and use FHE.select inside the loop.Suggested approach✅ For example, the previous code could maybe be replaced by the following snippet:= FHE.asEuint(6); // Could be a value between 0 and 10
euint8 x;
// some code
for (uint32 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
euint8 toAdd = FHE.select(FHE.lt(x, maxValue), 2, 0);
x = FHE.add(x, toAdd);
}In this snippet, we perform 10 iterations, adding 4 to x in each iteration as long as the iteration count is less than maxValue. If the iteration count exceeds maxValue, we add 0 instead for the remaining iterations because we can't break the loop.Best practicesObfuscate branchingThe previous paragraph emphasized that branch logic should rely as much as possible on FHE.select instead of decryptions. It hides effectively which branch has been executed.However, this is sometimes not enough. Enhancing the privacy of smart contracts often requires revisiting your application's logic.For example, if implementing a simple AMM for two encrypted ERC20 tokens based on a linear constant function, it is recommended to not only hide the amounts being swapped, but also the token which is swapped in a pair.✅ Here is a very simplified example implementation, we suppose here that the rate between tokenA and tokenB is constant and equals to 1:// ideally, the user already owns some amounts of both tokens and has pre-approved the AMM on both tokens
function swapTokensForTokens(
externalEuint32 encryptedAmountAIn,
externalEuint32 encryptedAmountBIn,
bytes calldata inputProof
) external {
euint32 encryptedAmountA = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmountAIn, inputProof); // even if amount is null, do a transfer to obfuscate trade direction
euint32 encryptedAmountB = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedAmountBIn, inputProof); // even if amount is null, do a transfer to obfuscate trade direction
// send tokens from user to AMM contract
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountA, tokenA);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenA).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountA);
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountB, tokenB);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenB).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountB);
// send tokens from AMM contract to user
// Price of tokenA in tokenB is constant and equal to 1, so we just swap the encrypted amounts here
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountB, tokenA);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenA).transfer(msg.sender, encryptedAmountB);
FHE.allowTransient(encryptedAmountA, tokenB);
IConfidentialERC20(tokenB).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), encryptedAmountA);
}Notice that to preserve confidentiality, we had to make two inputs transfers on both tokens from the user to the AMM contract, and similarly two output transfers from the AMM to the user, even if technically most of the times it will make sense that one of the user inputs encryptedAmountAIn or encryptedAmountBIn is actually an encrypted zero.This is different from a classical non-confidential AMM with regular ERC20 tokens: in this case, the user would need to just do one input transfer to the AMM on the token being sold, and receive only one output transfer from the AMM on the token being bought.Avoid using encrypted indexesUsing encrypted indexes to pick an element from an array without revealing it is not very efficient, because you would still need to loop on all the indexes to preserve confidentiality.However, there are plans to make this kind of operation much more efficient in the future, by adding specialized operators for arrays.For instance, imagine you have an encrypted array called encArray and you want to update an encrypted value x to match an item from this list, encArray[i], without disclosing which item you're choosing.❌ You must loop over all the indexes and check equality homomorphically, however this pattern is very expensive in gas and should be avoided whenever possible.euint32[] encArray;
function setXwithEncryptedIndex(externalEuint32 encryptedIndex, bytes calldata inputProof) public {
euint32 index = FHE.asEuint32(encryptedIndex, inputProof);
for (uint32 i = 0; i < encArray.length; i++) {
ebool isEqual = FHE.eq(index, i);
x = FHE.select(isEqual, encArray[i], x);
}
FHE.allowThis(x);

# ACL examples | Protocol

ACL examples | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListACL examplesThis page provides detailed instructions and examples on how to use and implement the ACL (Access Control List) in FHEVM. For an overview of ACL concepts and their importance, refer to the access control list (ACL) overview.Controlling access: permanent and transient allowancesThe ACL system allows you to define two types of permissions for accessing ciphertexts:Permanent allowanceFunction: FHE.allow(ciphertext, address)Purpose: Grants persistent access to a ciphertext for a specific address.Storage: Permissions are saved in a dedicated ACL contract, making them available across transactions.Alternative Solidity syntaxYou can also use method-chaining syntax for granting allowances since FHE is a Solidity library. FHE for *;
ciphertext.allow(address1).allow(address2);This is equivalent to calling FHE.allow(ciphertext, address1) followed by FHE.allow(ciphertext, address2).Transient allowanceFunction: FHE.allowTransient(ciphertext, address)Purpose: Grants temporary access for the duration of a single transaction.Storage: Permissions are stored in transient storage to save gas costs.Use Case: Ideal for passing encrypted values between functions or contracts during a transaction.Alternative Solidity syntaxMethod chaining is also available for transient allowances since FHE is a Solidity library.ciphertext.allowTransient(address1).allowTransient(address2);Syntactic sugarFunction: FHE.allowThis(ciphertext)Equivalent To: FHE.allow(ciphertext, address(this))Purpose: Simplifies granting permanent access to the current contract for managing ciphertexts.Alternative Solidity syntaxYou can also use method-chaining syntax for allowThis since FHE is a Solidity library.ciphertext.allowThis();Make publicly decryptableTo make a ciphertext publicly decryptable, you can use the FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext) function. This grants decryption rights to anyone, which is useful for scenarios where the encrypted value should be accessible by all.FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext);
// Or using method syntax:
ciphertext.makePubliclyDecryptable();Function: FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(ciphertext)Purpose: Makes the ciphertext decryptable by anyone.Use Case: When you want to publish encrypted results or data.You can combine multiple allowance methods (such as .allow(), .allowThis(), .allowTransient()) directly on ciphertext objects to grant access to several addresses or contracts in a single, fluent statement.Exampleciphertext.allowTransient(address1).allow(address2);
// Grant permanent access to the current contract and another address
ciphertext.allowThis().allow(address1);Best practicesVerifying sender accessWhen processing ciphertexts as input, it’s essential to validate that the sender is authorized to interact with the provided encrypted data. Failing to perform this verification can expose the system to inference attacks where malicious actors attempt to deduce private information.Example scenario: Confidential ERC20 attackConsider an Confidential ERC20 token. An attacker controlling two accounts, Account A and Account B, with 100 tokens in Account A, could exploit the system as follows:The attacker attempts to send the target user's encrypted balance from Account A to Account B.Observing the transaction outcome, the attacker gains information:If successful: The target's balance is equal to or less than 100 tokens.If failed: The target's balance exceeds 100 tokens.This type of attack allows the attacker to infer private balances without explicit access.To prevent this, always use the FHE.isSenderAllowed() function to verify that the sender has legitimate access to the encrypted amount being transferred.Example: secure verification // Ensure the sender is authorized to access the encrypted amount
require(FHE.isSenderAllowed(encryptedAmount), "Unauthorized access to encrypted amount.");
// Proceed with further logic
euint64 amount = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedAmount);
...
}By enforcing this check, you can safeguard against inference attacks and ensure that encrypted values are only manipulated by authorized entities.ACL for user decryptionIf a ciphertext can be decrypt by a user, explicit access must be granted to them. Additionally, the user decryption mechanism requires the signature of a public key associated with the contract address. Therefore, a value that needs to be decrypted must be explicitly authorized for both the user and the contract.Due to the user decryption mechanism, a user signs a public key associated with a specific contract; therefore, the ciphertext also needs to be allowed for the contract.Example: Secure Transfer in ConfidentialERC20 require(FHE.isSenderAllowed(encryptedAmount), "The caller is not authorized to access this encrypted amount.");
euint64 amount = FHE.asEuint64(encryptedAmount);
ebool canTransfer = FHE.le(amount, balances[msg.sender]);
euint64 newBalanceTo = FHE.add(balances[to], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint64(0)));
balances[to] = newBalanceTo;
// Allow this new balance for both the contract and the owner.
FHE.allowThis(newBalanceTo);
FHE.allow(newBalanceTo, to);
euint64 newBalanceFrom = FHE.sub(balances[from], FHE.select(canTransfer, amount, FHE.asEuint64(0)));
balances[from] = newBalanceFrom;
// Allow this new balance for both the contract and the owner.
FHE.allowThis(newBalanceFrom);
FHE.allow(newBalanceFrom, from);
}By understanding how to grant and verify permissions, you can effectively manage access to encrypted data in your FHEVM smart contracts. For additional context, see the ACL overview.PreviousAccess Control ListNextReorgs handlingLast updated 1 month ago

# Reorgs handling | Protocol

Reorgs handling | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageAccess Control ListReorgs handlingThis page provides detailed instructions on how to handle reorg risks on Ethereum when using FHEVM.Since ACL events are propagated from the FHEVM host chain to the Gateway immediately after being included in a block, dApp developers must take special care when encrypted information is critically important. For example, if an encrypted handle conceals the private key of a Bitcoin wallet holding significant funds, we need to ensure that this information cannot inadvertently leak to the wrong person due to a reorg on the FHEVM host chain. Therefore, it's the responsibility of dApp developers to prevent such scenarios by implementing a two-step ACL authorization process with a timelock between the request and the ACL call.Simple example: Handling reorg risk on EthereumOn Ethereum, a reorg can be up to 95 slots deep in the worst case, so waiting for more than 95 blocks should ensure that a previously sent transaction has been finalized—unless more than 1/3 of the nodes are malicious and willing to lose their stake, which is highly improbable.❌ Instead of writing this contract: PrivateKeySale {
euint256 privateKey;
bool isAlreadyBought = false;
constructor(externalEuint256 _privateKey, bytes inputProof) {
privateKey = FHE.fromExternal(_privateKey, inputProof);
FHE.allowThis(privateKey);
}
function buyPrivateKey() external payable {
require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Must pay 1 ETH");
require(!isBought, "Private key already bought");
isBought = true;
FHE.allow(encryptedPrivateKey, msg.sender);
}
}Since the `privateKey`` encrypted variable contains critical information, we don't want to mistakenly leak it for free if a reorg occurs. This could happen in the previous example because we immediately grant authorization to the buyer in the same transaction that processes the sale.✅ We recommend writing something like this instead: euint256 privateKey;
bool isAlreadyBought = false;
uint256 blockWhenBought = 0;
address buyer;
constructor(externalEuint256 _privateKey, bytes inputProof) {
privateKey = FHE.fromExternal(_privateKey, inputProof);
FHE.allowThis(privateKey);
}
function buyPrivateKey() external payable {
require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Must pay 1 ETH");
require(!isBought, "Private key already bought");
isBought = true;
blockWhenBought = block.number;
buyer = msg.sender;
}
function requestACL() external {
require(isBought, "Private key has not been bought yet");
require(block.number > blockWhenBought + 95, "Too early to request ACL, risk of reorg");
FHE.allow(privateKey, buyer);
}
}This approach ensures that at least 96 blocks have elapsed between the transaction that purchases the private key and the transaction that authorizes the buyer to decrypt it.This type of contract worsens the user experience by adding a timelock before users can decrypt data, so it should be used sparingly: only when leaked information could be critically important and high-value.PreviousACL examplesNextLogicsLast updated 1 month ago

# HCU | Protocol

HCU | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHCUThis guide explains how to use Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) operations in your smart contracts on FHEVM. Understanding HCU is critical for designing efficient confidential smart contracts.OverviewFHE operations in FHEVM are computationally intensive compared to standard Ethereum operations, as they require complex mathematical computations to maintain privacy and security. To manage computational load and prevent potential denial-of-service attacks, FHEVM implements a metering system called Homomorphic Complexity Units ("HCU").To represent this complexity, we introduced the Homomorphic Complexity Unit ("HCU"). In Solidity, each FHE operation consumes a set amount of HCU based on the operational computational complexity for hardware computation. Since FHE transactions are symbolic, this helps preventing resource exhaustion outside of the blockchain.To do so, there is a contract named HCULimit, which monitors HCU consumption for each transaction and enforces two key limits:Sequential homomorphic operations depth limit per transaction: Controls HCU usage for operations that must be processed in order.Global homomorphic operations complexity per transaction: Controls HCU usage for operations that can be processed in parallel.If either limit is exceeded, the transaction will revert.HCU limitThe current devnet has an HCU limit of 20,000,000 per transaction and an HCU depth limit of 5,000,000 per transaction. If either HCU limit is exceeded, the transaction will revert.To resolve this, you must do one of the following:Refactor your code to reduce the number of FHE operations in your transaction.Split your FHE operations across multiple independent transactions.HCU costs for common operationsBoolean operations (ebool)and22,00025,000or22,00024,000xor2,00022,000not-2select-55,000randEbool-19,000Unsigned integer operationsHCU increase with the bit-width of the encrypted integer type.

# How to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract? | Protocol

How to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract? | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHow to Transform Your Smart Contract into a FHEVM Smart Contract?This short guide will walk you through converting a standard Solidity contract into one that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) using FHEVM. This approach lets you develop your contract logic as usual, then adapt it to support encrypted computation for privacy.For this guide, we will focus on a voting contract example.1. Start with a Standard Solidity ContractBegin by writing your voting contract in Solidity as you normally would. Focus on implementing the core logic and functionality.
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SimpleVoting {
mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
uint64 public yesVotes;
uint64 public noVotes;
uint256 public voteDeadline;
function vote(bool support) public {
require(block.timestamp <= voteDeadline, "Too late to vote");
require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
if (support) {
yesVotes += 1;
} else {
noVotes += 1;
}
}
function getResults() public view returns (uint64, uint64) {
return (yesVotes, noVotes);
}
}2. Identify Sensitive Data and OperationsReview your contract and determine which variables, functions, or computations require privacy. In this example, the vote counts (yesVotes, noVotes) and individual votes should be encrypted.3. Integrate FHEVM and update your business logic accordingly.Replace standard data types and operations with their FHEVM equivalents for the identified sensitive parts. Use encrypted types and FHEVM library functions to perform computations on encrypted data.
import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import {SepoliaConfig} from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
contract EncryptedSimpleVoting is SepoliaConfig {
enum VotingStatus {
Open,
DecryptionInProgress,
ResultsDecrypted
}
mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
VotingStatus public status;
uint64 public decryptedYesVotes;
uint64 public decryptedNoVotes;
uint256 public voteDeadline;
euint64 private encryptedYesVotes;
euint64 private encryptedNoVotes;
constructor() {
encryptedYesVotes = FHE.asEuint64(0);
encryptedNoVotes = FHE.asEuint64(0);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedYesVotes);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedNoVotes);
}
function vote(externalEbool support, bytes memory inputProof) public {
require(block.timestamp <= voteDeadline, "Too late to vote");
require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
ebool isSupport = FHE.fromExternal(support, inputProof);
encryptedYesVotes = FHE.select(isSupport, FHE.add(encryptedYesVotes, 1), encryptedYesVotes);
encryptedNoVotes = FHE.select(isSupport, encryptedNoVotes, FHE.add(encryptedNoVotes, 1));
FHE.allowThis(encryptedYesVotes);
FHE.allowThis(encryptedNoVotes);
}
function requestVoteDecryption() public {
require(block.timestamp > voteDeadline, "Voting is not finished");
bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](2);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(encryptedYesVotes);
cts[1] = FHE.toBytes32(encryptedNoVotes);
uint256 requestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.callbackDecryptVotes.selector);
status = VotingStatus.DecryptionInProgress;
}
function callbackDecryptVotes(uint256 requestId, bytes memory cleartexts, bytes memory decryptionProof) public {
FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, cleartexts, decryptionProof);
(uint64 yesVotes, uint64 noVotes) = abi.decode(cleartexts, (uint64, uint64));
decryptedYesVotes = yesVotes;
decryptedNoVotes = noVotes;
status = VotingStatus.ResultsDecrypted;
}
function getResults() public view returns (uint64, uint64) {
require(status == VotingStatus.ResultsDecrypted, "Results were not decrypted");
return (
decryptedYesVotes,
decryptedNoVotes
);
}
}Adjust your contract’s code to accept and return encrypted data where necessary. This may involve changing function parameters and return types to work with ciphertexts instead of plaintext values, as shown above.The vote function now has two parameters: support and inputProof.The getResults can only be called after the decryption occurred. Otherwise, the decrypted results are not visible to anyone.However, it is far from being the main change. As this example illustrates, working with FHEVM often requires re-architecting the original logic to support privacy.In the updated code, the logic becomes async; results are hidden until a request (to the oracle) explicitely has to be made to decrypt publically the vote results.ConclusionAs this short guide showed, integrating with FHEVM not only requires integration with the FHEVM stack, it also requires refactoring your business logic to support mechanism to swift between encrypted and non-encrypted components of the logic.PreviousMigration guideLast updated 1 month ago

Deploy contracts and run tests | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHardhat pluginDeploy contracts and run testsIn this section, you'll find everything you need to test your FHEVM smart contracts in your Hardhat project.FHEVM Runtime ModesThe FHEVM Hardhat plugin provides three FHEVM runtime modes tailored for different stages of contract development and testing. Each mode offers a trade-off between speed, encryption, and persistence.The Hardhat (In-Memory) default network: 🧪 Uses mock encryption. Ideal for regular tests, CI test coverage, and fast feedback during early contract development. No real encryption is used.The Hardhat Node (Local Server) network: 🧪 Uses mock encryption. Ideal when you need persistent state - for example, when testing frontend interactions, simulating user flows, or validating deployments in a realistic local environment. Still uses mock encryption.The Sepolia Testnet network: 🔐 Uses real encryption. Use this mode once your contract logic is stable and validated locally. This is the only mode that runs on the full FHEVM stack with real encrypted values. It simulates real-world production conditions but is slower and requires Sepolia ETH.Zama Testnet is not a blockchain itself. It is a protocol that enables you to run confidential smart contracts on existing blockchains (such as Ethereum, Base, and others) with the support of encrypted types. See the FHE on blockchain guide to learn more about the protocol architecture.Currently, Zama Protocol is available on the Sepolia Testnet. Support for additional chains will be added in the future.

# Write FHEVM-enabled Hardhat Tasks | Protocol

Write FHEVM-enabled Hardhat Tasks | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageHardhat pluginWrite FHEVM-enabled Hardhat TasksIn this section, you'll learn how to write a custom FHEVM Hardhat task.Writing tasks is a gas-efficient and flexible way to test your FHEVM smart contracts on the Sepolia network. Creating a custom task is straightforward.PrerequisiteYou should be familiar with Hardhat tasks. If you're new to them, refer to the Hardhat Tasks official documentation.You should have already completed the FHEVM Tutorial.This page provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the task:decrypt-count tasks included in the file tasks/FHECounter.ts file, located in the fhevm-hardhat-template repository.1A Basic Hardhat Task.Let’s start with a simple example: fetching the current counter value from a basic Counter.sol contract.If you're already familiar with Hardhat and custom tasks, the TypeScript code below should look familiar and be easy to follow:("task:get-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")
.addOptionalParam("address", "Optionally specify the Counter contract address")
.setAction(async function (taskArguments: TaskArguments, hre) {
const { ethers, deployments } = hre;
const CounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
? { address: taskArguments.address }
: await deployments.get("Counter");
console.log(`Counter: ${CounterDeployement.address}`);
const counterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("Counter", CounterDeployement.address);
const clearCount = await counterContract.getCount();
console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);
});Now, let’s modify this task to work with FHEVM encrypted values.2Comment Out Existing Logic and renameFirst, comment out the existing logic so we can incrementally add the necessary changes for FHEVM integration.("task:get-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")
.addOptionalParam("address", "Optionally specify the Counter contract address")
.setAction(async function (taskArguments: TaskArguments, hre) {
// const { ethers, deployments } = hre;
// const CounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
// ? { address: taskArguments.address }
// : await deployments.get("Counter");
// console.log(`Counter: ${CounterDeployement.address}`);
// const counterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("Counter", CounterDeployement.address);
// const clearCount = await counterContract.getCount();
// console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);
});Next, rename the task by replacing:("task:get-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")With:("task:decrypt-count", "Calls the getCount() function of Counter Contract")This updates the task name from task:get-count to task:decrypt-count, reflecting that it now includes decryption logic for FHE-encrypted values.3Initialize FHEVM CLI APIReplace the line:// const { ethers, deployments } = hre;With:const { ethers, deployments, fhevm } = hre;
await fhevm.initializeCLIApi();Calling initializeCLIApi() is essential. Unlike built-in Hardhat tasks like test or compile, which automatically initialize the FHEVM runtime environment, custom tasks require you to call this function explicitly. Make sure to call it at the very beginning of your task to ensure the environment is properly set up.4Call the view function getCount from the FHECounter contractReplace the following commented-out lines:// const CounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
// ? { address: taskArguments.address }
// : await deployments.get("Counter");
// console.log(`Counter: ${CounterDeployement.address}`);
// const counterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("Counter", CounterDeployement.address);
// const clearCount = await counterContract.getCount();With the FHEVM equivalent:const FHECounterDeployement = taskArguments.address
? { address: taskArguments.address }
: await deployments.get("FHECounter");
console.log(`FHECounter: ${FHECounterDeployement.address}`);
const fheCounterContract = await ethers.getContractAt("FHECounter", FHECounterDeployement.address);
const encryptedCount = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
if (encryptedCount === ethers.ZeroHash) {
console.log(`encrypted count: ${encryptedCount}`);
console.log("clear count : 0");
return;
}Here, encryptedCount is an FHE-encrypted euint32 primitive. To retrieve the actual value, we need to decrypt it in the next step.5Decrypt the encrypted count value.Now replace the following commented-out line:// console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);With the decryption logic:const signers = await ethers.getSigners();
const clearCount = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCount,
FHECounterDeployement.address,
signers[0],
);
console.log(`Encrypted count: ${encryptedCount}`);
console.log(`Clear count : ${clearCount}`);At this point, your custom Hardhat task is fully configured to work with FHE-encrypted values and ready to run!6Step 6: Run your custom task using Hardhat NodeStart the Local Hardhat Node:Open a new terminal window.From the root project directory, run the following: hardhat nodeDeploy the FHECounter smart contract on the local Hardhat Node hardhat deploy --network localhostRun your custom task hardhat task:decrypt-count --network localhost7Step 7: Run your custom task using SepoliaDeploy the FHECounter smart contract on Sepolia Testnet (if not already deployed) hardhat deploy --network sepoliaExecute your custom task hardhat task:decrypt-count --network sepoliaPreviousDeploy contracts and run testsNextFoundryLast updated 1 month ago

Set up Hardhat | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageSet up HardhatIn this section, you’ll learn how to set up a FHEVM Hardhat development environment using the FHEVM Hardhat template as a starting point for building and testing fully homomorphic encrypted smart contracts.Create a local Hardhat Project1Install a Node.js TLS versionEnsure that Node.js is installed on your machine.Download and install the recommended LTS (Long-Term Support) version from the official website.Use an even-numbered version (e.g., v18.x, v20.x)Hardhat does not support odd-numbered Node.js versions. If you’re using one (e.g., v21.x, v23.x), Hardhat will display a persistent warning message and may behave unexpectedly.To verify your installation: -v
npm -v2Create a new GitHub repository from the FHEVM Hardhat template.On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the FHEVM Hardhat template repository.Above the file list, click the green Use this template button.Follow the instructions to create a new repository from the FHEVM Hardhat template.See Github doc: Creating a repository from a template3Clone your newly created GitHub repository locallyNow that your GitHub repository has been created, you can clone it to your local machine: <your-preferred-location>
git clone <url-to-your-new-repo>
# Set up Hardhat | Protocol
cd <your-new-repo-name>Next, let’s install your local Hardhat development environment.4Install your FHEVM Hardhat project dependenciesFrom the project root directory, run: installThis will install all required dependencies defined in your package.json, setting up your local FHEVM Hardhat development environment.5Set up the Hardhat configuration variables (optional)If you do plan to deploy to the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet, you'll need to set up the following Hardhat Configuration variables.MNEMONICA mnemonic is a 12-word seed phrase used to generate your Ethereum wallet keys.Get one by creating a wallet with MetaMask, or using any trusted mnemonic generator.Set it up in your Hardhat project: hardhat vars set MNEMONICINFURA_API_KEYThe INFURA project key allows you to connect to Ethereum testnets like Sepolia.Obtain one by following the Infura + MetaMask setup guide.Configure it in your project: hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEYDefault ValuesIf you skip this step, Hardhat will fall back to these defaults:MNEMONIC = "test test test test test test test test test test test junk"INFURA_API_KEY = "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"These defaults are not suitable for real deployments.Missing variable error:If any of the requested Hardhat Configuration Variables is missing, you'll get an error message like this one:Error HH1201: Cannot find a value for the configuration variable 'MNEMONIC'. Use 'npx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC' to set it or 'npx hardhat var setup' to list all the configuration variables used by this project.Congratulations!

4. Test the FHEVM contract | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick start tutorial4. Test the FHEVM contractIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to migrate a standard Hardhat test suite - from Counter.ts to its FHEVM-compatible version FHECounter.ts — and progressively enhance it to support Fully Homomorphic Encryption using Zama’s FHEVM library.Set up the FHEVM testing environment1Create a test script test/FHECounter.tsGo to your project's test directory <your-project-root-directory>/testFrom there, create a new file named FHECounter.ts and copy/paste the following Typescript skeleton code in it. { FHECounter, FHECounter__factory } from "../types";
import { FhevmType } from "@fhevm/hardhat-plugin";
import { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers, fhevm } from "hardhat";
type Signers = {
deployer: HardhatEthersSigner;

bob: HardhatEthersSigner;
};
async function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("FHECounter")) as FHECounter__factory;
const fheCounterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as FHECounter;
const fheCounterContractAddress = await fheCounterContract.getAddress();
return { fheCounterContract, fheCounterContractAddress };
}
describe("FHECounter", function () {

});What’s Different from Counter.ts?This test file is structurally similar to the original Counter.ts, but it uses the FHEVM-compatible smart contract FHECounter instead of the regular Counter.– For clarity, the Counter unit tests are included as comments, allowing you to better understand how each part is adapted during the migration to FHEVM.While the test logic remains the same, this version is now set up to support encrypted computations via the FHEVM library — enabling tests that manipulate confidential values directly on-chain.2Run the test test/FHECounter.tsFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testOutput:FHECounter

✔ should be deployed
1 passing (1ms)Great! Your Hardhat FHEVM test environment is properly setup.Test functionsNow everything is up and running, you can start testing your contract functions.1Call the contract getCount() view functionReplace the commented‐out test for the legacy Counter contract:
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// console.log(`Counter.getCount() === ${count}`);
// // Expect initial count to be 0 after deployment
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });with its FHEVM equivalent:("encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment", async function () {
const encryptedCount = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
// Expect initial count to be bytes32(0) after deployment,
// (meaning the encrypted count value is uninitialized)
expect(encryptedCount).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
});What’s different?– encryptedCount is no longer a plain TypeScript number. It is now a hexadecimal string representing a Solidity bytes32 value, known as an FHEVM handle. This handle points to an encrypted FHEVM primitive of type euint32, which internally represents an encrypted Solidity uint32 primitive type.encryptedCount is equal to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 which means that encryptedCount is uninitialized, and does not reference to any encrypted value at this point.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputCounter
Counter has been deployed at address 0x7553CB9124f974Ee475E5cE45482F90d5B6076BC
✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
2 passing (7ms)2Setup the increment() function unit testWe’ll migrate the increment() unit test to FHEVM step by step. To start, let’s handle the value of the counter before the first increment. As explained above, the counter is initially a bytes32 value equal to zero, meaning the FHEVM euint32 variable is uninitialized.We’ll interpret this as if the underlying clear value is 0.Replace the commented‐out test for the legacy Counter contract:
// const countBeforeInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
// });with the following:("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});3Encrypt the increment() function argumentThe increment() function takes a single argument: the value by which the counter should be incremented. In the initial version of Counter.sol, this value is a clear uint32.We’ll switch to passing an encrypted value instead, using FHEVM externalEuint32 primitive type. This allows us to securely increment the counter without revealing the input value on-chain.We are using an externalEuint32 instead of a regular euint32. This tells the FHEVM that the encrypted uint32 was provided externally (e.g., by a user) and must be verified for integrity and authenticity before it can be used within the contract.Replace :("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});with the following:("increment the counter by 1", async function () {
const encryptedCountBeforeInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
expect(encryptedCountBeforeInc).to.eq(ethers.ZeroHash);
const clearCountBeforeInc = 0;
// Encrypt constant 1 as a euint32
const clearOne = 1;
const encryptedOne = await fhevm
.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address)
.add32(clearOne)
.encrypt();
// const tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});fhevm.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address) creates an encrypted value that is bound to both the contract (fheCounterContractAddress) and the user (signers.alice.address). This means only Alice can use this encrypted value, and only within the FHECounter.sol contract at that specific address. It cannot be reused by another user or in a different contract, ensuring data confidentiality and binding context-specific encryption.4Call the increment() function with the encrypted argumentNow that we have an encrypted argument, we can call the increment() function with it.Below, you’ll notice that the updated increment() function now takes two arguments instead of one.This is because the FHEVM requires both:The externalEuint32 — the encrypted value itselfAn accompanying Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (inputProof) — which verifies that the encrypted input is securely bound to:the caller (Alice, the transaction signer), andthe target smart contract (where increment() is being executed)This ensures that the encrypted value cannot be reused in a different context or by a different user, preserving confidentiality and integrity.Replace :
// await tx.wait();with the following: tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();At this point the counter has been successfully incremented by 1 using a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). In the next step, we will retrieve the updated encrypted counter value and decrypt it locally. But before we move on, let’s quickly run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter
FHECounter has been deployed at address 0x7553CB9124f974Ee475E5cE45482F90d5B6076BC
✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
3 passing (7ms)5Call the getCount() function and Decrypt the valueNow that the counter has been incremented using an encrypted input, it's time to read the updated encrypted value from the smart contract and decrypt it using the userDecryptEuint function provided by the FHEVM Hardhat Plugin.The userDecryptEuint function takes four parameters:FhevmType: The integer type of the FHE-encrypted value. In this case, we're using FhevmType.euint32 because the counter is a uint32.Encrypted handle: A 32-byte FHEVM handle representing the encrypted value you want to decrypt.Smart contract address: The address of the contract that has permission to access the encrypted handle.User signer: The signer (e.g., signers.alice) who has permission to access the handle.Note: Permissions to access the FHEVM handle are set on-chain using the FHE.allow() Solidity function (see FHECounter.sol).Replace :
// expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);with the following: encryptedCountAfterInc = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
const clearCountAfterInc = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCountAfterInc,
fheCounterContractAddress,
signers.alice,
);
expect(clearCountAfterInc).to.eq(clearCountBeforeInc + clearOne);Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter

✔ should be deployed
✔ encrypted count should be uninitialized after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
3 passing (7ms)6Call the contract decrement() functionSimilarly to the previous test, we’ll now call the decrement() function using an encrypted input.Replace :
// // First increment, count becomes 1
// let tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment();
// await tx.wait();
// // Then decrement, count goes back to 0
// tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(1);
// await tx.wait();
// const count = await counterContract.getCount();
// expect(count).to.eq(0);
// });with the following:("decrement the counter by 1", async function () {
// Encrypt constant 1 as a euint32
const clearOne = 1;
const encryptedOne = await fhevm
.createEncryptedInput(fheCounterContractAddress, signers.alice.address)
.add32(clearOne)
.encrypt();
// First increment by 1, count becomes 1
let tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();
// Then decrement by 1, count goes back to 0
tx = await fheCounterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(encryptedOne.handles[0], encryptedOne.inputProof);
await tx.wait();
const encryptedCountAfterDec = await fheCounterContract.getCount();
const clearCountAfterDec = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
FhevmType.euint32,
encryptedCountAfterDec,
fheCounterContractAddress,
signers.alice,
);
expect(clearCountAfterDec).to.eq(0);
});Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected OutputFHECounter

# 3. Turn it into FHEVM | Protocol

3. Turn it into FHEVM | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuick start tutorial3. Turn it into FHEVMIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to take a basic Solidity smart contract and progressively upgrade it to support Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the FHEVM library by Zama.Starting with the plain Counter.sol contract that you built from the "Write a simple contract" tutorial, and step-by-step, you’ll learn how to:Replace standard types with encrypted equivalentsIntegrate zero-knowledge proof validationEnable encrypted on-chain computationGrant permissions for secure off-chain decryptionBy the end, you'll have a fully functional smart contract that supports FHE computation.Initiate the contract1Create the FHECounter.sol fileNavigate to your project’s contracts directory: <your-project-root-directory>/contractsFrom there, create a new file named FHECounter.sol, and copy the following Solidity code into it:
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
/// @title A simple counter contract
contract Counter {
uint32 private _count;
/// @notice Returns the current count
function getCount() external view returns (uint32) {
return _count;
}
/// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(uint32 value) external {
_count += value;
}
/// @notice Decrements the counter by a specific value
function decrement(uint32 value) external {
require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
_count -= value;
}
}This is a plain Counter contract that we’ll use as the starting point for adding FHEVM functionality. We will modify this contract step-by-step to progressively integrate FHEVM capabilities.2Turn Counter into FHECounterTo begin integrating FHEVM features into your contract, we first need to import the required FHEVM libraries.Replace the current header
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;With this updated header:
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import { FHE, euint32, externalEuint32 } from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";These imports:FHE — the core library to work with FHEVM encrypted typeseuint32 and externalEuint32 — encrypted uint32 types used in FHEVMSepoliaConfig — provides the FHEVM configuration for the Sepolia network.
Inheriting from it enables your contract to use the FHE libraryReplace the current contract declaration:@title A simple counter contract
contract Counter {With the updated declaration :@title A simple FHE counter contract
contract FHECounter is SepoliaConfig {This change:Renames the contract to FHECounterInherits from SepoliaConfig to enable FHEVM supportThis contract must inherit from the SepoliaConfig abstract contract; otherwise, it will not be able to execute any FHEVM-related functionality on Sepolia or Hardhat.From your project's root directory, run: hardhat compileGreat! Your smart contract is now compiled and ready to use FHEVM features.Apply FHE functions and types1Comment out the increment() and decrement() FunctionsBefore we move forward, let’s comment out the increment() and decrement() functions in FHECounter. We'll replace them later with updated versions that support FHE-encrypted operations./// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
// function increment(uint32 value) external {
// _count += value;
// }
/// @notice Decrements the counter by a specific value
// function decrement(uint32 value) external {
// require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
// _count -= value;
// }2Replace uint32 with the FHEVM euint32 TypeWe’ll now switch from the standard Solidity uint32 type to the encrypted FHEVM type euint32.This enables private, homomorphic computation on encrypted integers.Replace _count;and getCount() external view returns (uint32) {With :and getCount() external view returns (euint32) {3Replace increment(uint32 value) with the FHEVM version increment(externalEuint32 value)To support encrypted input, we will update the increment function to accept a value encrypted off-chain.Instead of using a uint32, the new version will accept an externalEuint32, which is an encrypted integer produced off-chain and sent to the smart contract.To ensure the validity of this encrypted value, we also include a second argument:inputProof, a bytes array containing a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPoK) that proves two things:The externalEuint32 was encrypted off-chain by the function caller (msg.sender)The externalEuint32 is bound to the contract (address(this)) and can only be processed by it.Replace/// @notice Increments the counter by a specific value
// function increment(uint32 value) external {
// _count += value;
// }With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
// _count += value;
}4Convert externalEuint32 to euint32You cannot directly use externalEuint32 in FHE operations. To manipulate it with the FHEVM library, you first need to convert it into the native FHE type euint32.This conversion is done using:fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);This method verifies the zero-knowledge proof and returns a usable encrypted value within the contract.Replace@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
// _count += value;
}With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
// _count += value;
}5Convert _count += value into its FHEVM equivalentTo perform the update _count += value in a Fully Homomorphic way, we use the FHE.add() operator. This function allows us to compute the FHE sum of 2 encrypted integers.Replace@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
// _count += value;
}With :@notice Increments the counter by a specific value
function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
}This FHE operation allows the smart contract to process encrypted values without ever decrypting them — a core feature of FHEVM that enables on-chain privacy.Grant FHE PermissionsThis step is critical! You must grant FHE permissions to both the contract and the caller to ensure the encrypted _count value can be decrypted off-chain by the caller. Without these 2 permissions, the caller will not be able to compute the clear result.To grant FHE permission we will call the FHE.allow() function.Replacefunction increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
}With :function increment(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 evalue = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.add(_count, evalue);
FHE.allowThis(_count);
FHE.allow(_count, msg.sender);
}We grant two FHE permissions here — not just one. In the next part of the tutorial, you'll learn why both are necessary.Convert decrement() to its FHEVM equivalentJust like with the increment() migration, we’ll now convert the decrement() function to its FHEVM-compatible version.Replace :function decrement(uint32 value) external {
require(_count >= value, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
_count -= value;
}with the following :/// @dev This example omits overflow/underflow checks for simplicity and readability.
/// In a production contract, proper range checks should be implemented.
function decrement(externalEuint32 inputEuint32, bytes calldata inputProof) external {
euint32 encryptedEuint32 = FHE.fromExternal(inputEuint32, inputProof);
_count = FHE.sub(_count, encryptedEuint32);
FHE.allowThis(_count);
FHE.allow(_count, msg.sender);
}The increment() and decrement() functions do not perform any overflow or underflow checks.Compile FHECounter.solFrom your project's root directory, run:Congratulations! Your smart contract is now fully FHEVM-compatible.Now you should have the following files in your project:contracts/FHECounter.sol — your Solidity smart FHEVM contracttest/FHECounter.ts — your FHEVM Hardhat test suite written in TypeScriptIn the next tutorial, we’ll move on to the TypeScript integration, where you’ll learn how to interact with your newly upgraded FHEVM contract in a test suite.Previous2.

Your Hardhat test environment is properly setup.3Set up the test signersBefore interacting with smart contracts in Hardhat tests, we need to initialize signers.In the context of Ethereum development, a signer represents an entity (usually a wallet) that can send transactions and sign messages. In Hardhat, ethers.getSigners() returns a list of pre-funded test accounts.We’ll define three named signers for convenience:owner — the deployer of the contractalice and bob — additional simulated usersReplace the contents of test/Counter.ts with the following: { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
type Signers = {
owner: HardhatEthersSigner;
alice: HardhatEthersSigner;
bob: HardhatEthersSigner;
};

let signers: Signers;

1 passing (2ms)4Set up testing instanceNow that we have our signers set up, we can deploy the smart contract.To ensure isolated and deterministic tests, we should deploy a fresh instance of Counter.sol before each test. This avoids any side effects from previous tests.The standard approach is to define a deployFixture() function that handles contract deployment. function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("Counter")) as Counter__factory;
const counterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as Counter;
const counterContractAddress = await counterContract.getAddress();
return { counterContract, counterContractAddress };
}To run this setup before each test case, call deployFixture() inside a beforeEach block:(async () => {
({ counterContract, counterContractAddress } = await deployFixture());
});This ensures each test runs with a clean, independent contract instance.Let's put it together. Now yourtest/Counter.ts should look like the following: { Counter, Counter__factory } from "../types";
import { HardhatEthersSigner } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
type Signers = {
deployer: HardhatEthersSigner;
alice: HardhatEthersSigner;
bob: HardhatEthersSigner;
};
async function deployFixture() {
const factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory("Counter")) as Counter__factory;
const counterContract = (await factory.deploy()) as Counter;
const counterContractAddress = await counterContract.getAddress();
return { counterContract, counterContractAddress };
}
describe("Counter", function () {
let signers: Signers;
let counterContract: Counter;
let counterContractAddress: Counter;
before(async function () {
const ethSigners: HardhatEthersSigner[] = await ethers.getSigners();
signers = { deployer: ethSigners[0], alice: ethSigners[1], bob: ethSigners[2] };
});
beforeEach(async () => {
// Deploy a new instance of the contract before each test
({ counterContract, counterContractAddress } = await deployFixture());
});
it("should be deployed", async function () {
console.log(`Counter has been deployed at address ${counterContractAddress}`);
// Test the deployed address is valid
expect(ethers.isAddress(counterContractAddress)).to.eq(true);
});
});Run the test:From your project's root directory, run: hardhat testExpected Output:Counter

const countAfterInc = await counterContract.getCount();
expect(countAfterInc).to.eq(countBeforeInc + 1n);
});Remarks:increment() is a transactional function that modifies the blockchain state.It must be signed by a user — here we use alice.await wait() to wait for the transaction to mined.The test compares the counter before and after the transaction to ensure it incremented as expected.Run the testFrom your project's root directory, run:Expected OutputCounter has been deployed at address 0x7553CB9124f974Ee475E5cE45482F90d5B6076BC

✔ count should be zero after deployment
✔ increment the counter by 1
2 passing (12ms)3Call the contract decrement() transaction functionJust below the test block it("increment the counter by 1", async function () {...},add the following test block: // First increment, count becomes 1
let tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).increment(1);

// Then decrement, count goes back to 0
tx = await counterContract.connect(signers.alice).decrement(1);
await tx.wait();
const count = await counterContract.getCount();

# User decryption | Protocol

User decryption | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageDecryptionUser decryptionThis document explains how to perform user decryption. User decryption is required when you want a user to access their private data without it being exposed to the blockchain.User decryption in FHEVM enables the secure sharing or reuse of encrypted data under a new public key without exposing the plaintext.This feature is essential for scenarios where encrypted data must be transferred between contracts, dApps, or users while maintaining its confidentiality.When to use user decryptionUser decryption is particularly useful for allowing individual users to securely access and decrypt their private data, such as balances or counters, while maintaining data confidentiality.OverviewThe user decryption process involves retrieving ciphertext from the blockchain and performing user-decryption on the client-side. In other words we take the data that has been encrypted by the KMS, decrypt it and encrypt it with the user's private key, so only he can access the information.This ensures that the data remains encrypted under the blockchain’s FHE key but can be securely shared with a user by re-encrypting it under the user’s NaCl public key.User decryption is facilitated by the Relayer and the Key Management System (KMS). The workflow consists of the following:Retrieving the ciphertext from the blockchain using a contract’s view function.Re-encrypting the ciphertext client-side with the user’s public key, ensuring only the user can decrypt it.Step 1: retrieve the ciphertextTo retrieve the ciphertext that needs to be decrypted, you can implement a view function in your smart contract. Below is an example implementation: "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
contract ConfidentialERC20 {
...
function balanceOf(account address) public view returns (euint64) {
return balances[msg.sender];
}
...
}Here, balanceOf allows retrieval of the user’s encrypted balance handle stored on the blockchain. Doing this will return the ciphertext handle, an identifier for the underlying ciphertext.For the user to be able to user decrypt (also called re-encrypt) the ciphertext value the access control (ACL) needs to be set properly using the FHE.allow(ciphertext, address) function in the solidity contract holding the ciphertext.For more details on the topic please refer to the ACL documentation.Step 2: decrypt the ciphertextUsing that ciphertext handle user decryption is performed client-side using the @zama-fhe/relayer-sdk library. The user needs to have created an instance object prior to that (for more context see the relayer-sdk setup page).// signer: [`Signer`] from ethers (could a [`Wallet`])
// ciphertextHandle: [`string`]
// contractAddress: [`string`]
const keypair = instance.generateKeypair();
const handleContractPairs = [
{
handle: ciphertextHandle,

# User decryption | Protocol

User decryption | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageDecryptionUser decryptionThis document explains how to perform user decryption. User decryption is required when you want a user to access their private data without it being exposed to the blockchain.User decryption in FHEVM enables the secure sharing or reuse of encrypted data under a new public key without exposing the plaintext.This feature is essential for scenarios where encrypted data must be transferred between contracts, dApps, or users while maintaining its confidentiality.When to use user decryptionUser decryption is particularly useful for allowing individual users to securely access and decrypt their private data, such as balances or counters, while maintaining data confidentiality.OverviewThe user decryption process involves retrieving ciphertext from the blockchain and performing user-decryption on the client-side. In other words we take the data that has been encrypted by the KMS, decrypt it and encrypt it with the users private key, so only he can access the information.This ensures that the data remains encrypted under the blockchain’s FHE key but can be securely shared with a user by re-encrypting it under the user’s NaCl public key.User decryption is facilitated by the Relayer and the Key Management System (KMS). The workflow consists of the following:Retrieving the ciphertext from the blockchain using a contract’s view function.Re-encrypting the ciphertext client-side with the user’s public key, ensuring only the user can decrypt it.Step 1: retrieve the ciphertextTo retrieve the ciphertext that needs to be decrypted, you can implement a view function in your smart contract. Below is an example implementation: "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
contract ConfidentialERC20 {
...
function balanceOf(account address) public view returns (euint64) {
return balances[msg.sender];
}
...
}Here, balanceOf allows retrieval of the user’s encrypted balance handle stored on the blockchain. Doing this will return the ciphertext handle, an identifier for the underlying ciphertext.For the user to be able to user decrypt (also called re-encrypt) the ciphertext value the access control (ACL) needs to be set properly using the FHE.allow(ciphertext, address) function in the solidity contract holding the ciphertext. For more details on the topic please refer to the ACL documentation.Step 2: decrypt the ciphertextUsing that ciphertext handle user decryption is performed client-side using the @zama-fhe/relayer-sdk library. The user needs to have created an instance object prior to that (for more context see the relayer-sdk setup page).// signer: [`Signer`] from ethers (could a [`Wallet`])
// ciphertextHandle: [`string`]

Acting as a decentralized compute layer, the coprocessor bridges symbolic on-chain logic with real-world encrypted execution.Coprocessor works together with the Gateway, verifying encrypted inputs, executing FHE instructions, and maintaining synchronization of access permissions, in particulaListens to events emitted by host chains and the Gateway.Executes FHE computations (add, mul, div, cmp, etc.) on ciphertexts.Validates encrypted inputs and ZK proofs of correctness.Maintains and updates a replica of the host chain’s Access Control Lists (ACLs).Stores and serves encrypted data for decryption or bridging.Each coprocessor independently executes tasks and publishes verifiable results, enabling a publicly auditable and horizontally scalable confidential compute infrastructure .Responsibilities of the CoprocessorEncrypted input verificationWhen users submit encrypted values to the Gateway, each coprocessor:Verifies the associated Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPoK).Extracts and unpacks individual ciphertexts from a packed submission.Stores the ciphertexts under derived handles.Signs the verified handles, embedding user and contract metadata.Sends the signed data back to the Gateway for consensus.This ensures only valid, well-formed encrypted values enter the system .FHE computation executionWhen a smart contract executes a function over encrypted values, the on-chain logic emits symbolic computation events.
Each coprocessor:Reads these events from the host chain node it runs.Fetches associated ciphertexts from its storage.Executes the required FHE operations using the TFHE-rs library (e.g., add, mul, select).Stores the resulting ciphertext under a deterministically derived handle.Optionally publishes a commitment (digest) of the ciphertext to the Gateway for verifiability.This offloads expensive computation from the host chain while maintaining full determinism and auditability .ACL replicationCoprocessors replicate the Access Control List (ACL) logic from host contracts. They:Listen to Allowed and AllowedForDecryption events.Push updates to the Gateway.This ensures decentralized enforcement of access rights, enabling proper handling of decryptions, bridges, and contract interactions .Ciphertext commitmentTo ensure verifiability and mitigate misbehavior, each coprocessor:Commits to ciphertext digests (via hash) when processing Allowed events.Publishes these commitments to the Gateway.Enables external verification of FHE computations.This is essential for fraud-proof mechanisms and eventual slashing of malicious or faulty operators .Bridging & decryption supportCoprocessors assist in:Bridging encrypted values between host chains by generating new handles and signatures.Preparing ciphertexts for public and user decryption using operations like Switch-n-Squash to normalize ciphertexts
for the KMS.These roles help maintain cross-chain interoperability and enable privacy-preserving data access for users and smart contracts .Security and trust assumptionsCoprocessors are designed to be minimally trusted and publicly verifiable. Every FHE computation or input verification they perform is accompanied by a cryptographic commitment (hash digest) and a signature, allowing anyone to independently verify correctness.The protocol relies on a majority-honest assumption: as long as more than 50% of coprocessors are honest, results are valid. The Gateway aggregates responses and accepts outputs only when a majority consensus is reached.To enforce honest behavior, coprocessors must stake $ZAMA tokens and are subject to slashing if caught misbehaving—either through automated checks or governance-based fraud proofs.This model ensures correctness through transparency, resilience through decentralization, and integrity through economic incentives.Architecture & ScalabilityThe coprocessor architecture includes:Event listeners for host chains and the GatewayA task queue for FHE and ACL update jobsWorker threads that process tasks in parallelA public storage layer (e.g., S3) for ciphertext availabilityThis modular setup supports horizontal scaling: adding more workers or machines increases throughput. Symbolic
computation and delayed execution also ensure low gas costs on-chain .PreviousHost contractsNextGatewayLast updated 3 months ago

It does this by:Accepting encrypted inputs along with Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPoKs).Emitting verification events for coprocessors to validate.Aggregating signatures from a majority of coprocessors to generate attestations, which can then be used on-chain as
trusted external values.Access Control coordinationThe Gateway maintains a synchronized copy of Access Control Lists (ACLs) from host chains, enabling it to independently
determine if decryption or computation rights should be granted for a ciphertext. This helps enforce:Access permissions (allow)Public decryption permissions (allowForDecryption)These ACL updates are replicated by coprocessors and pushed to the Gateway for verification and enforcement.Decryption orchestrationWhen a smart contract or user requests the decryption of an encrypted value:The Gateway verifies ACL permissions.It then triggers the KMS to decrypt (either publicly or privately).Once the KMS returns signed results, the Gateway emits events that can be picked up by an oracle (for smart contract
decryption) or returned to the user (for private decryption).This ensures asynchronous, secure, and auditable decryption without the Gateway itself knowing the plaintext.Cross-chain bridgingThe Gateway also handles bridging of encrypted handles between host chains. It:Verifies access rights on the source chain using its ACL copy.Requests the coprocessors to compute new handles for the target chain.Collects signatures from coprocessors.Issues attestations allowing these handles to be used on the destination chain.Consensus and slashing enforcementThe Gateway enforces consensus across decentralized coprocessors and KMS nodes. If discrepancies occur:Coprocessors must provide commitments to ciphertexts.Fraudulent or incorrect behavior can be challenged and slashed.Governance mechanisms can be triggered for off-chain verification when necessary.Protocol administrationThe Gateway runs smart contracts that administer:Operator and participant registration (coprocessors, KMS nodes, host chains)Key management and rotationBridging logicInput validation and decryption workflowsSecurity and trust assumptionsThe Gateway is designed to operate without requiring trust:It does not perform any computation itself—it merely orchestrates and validates.All actions are signed, and cryptographic verification is built into every step.The protocol assumes no trust in the Gateway for security guarantees—it can be fully audited and replaced if necessary.PreviousCoprocessorNextKMSLast updated 3 months ago

They serve as the minimal and foundational interface that confidential smart contracts use to:Interact with encrypted data (handles)Perform access control operationsEmit events for the off-chain components (coprocessors, Gateway)These host contracts are used indirectly by developers via the FHEVM Solidity library, abstracting away complexity and integrating smoothly into existing workflows.Responsibilities of host contractsTrusted interface layerHost contracts are the only on-chain components that:Maintain and enforce Access Control Lists (ACLs) for ciphertexts.Emit events that trigger coprocessor execution.Validate access permissions (persistent, transient, or decryption-related).They are effectively the on-chain authority for:Who is allowed to access a ciphertextWhen and how they can use itThese ACLs are mirrored on the Gateway for off-chain enforcement and bridging.Access Control APIHost contracts expose access control logic via standardized function calls (wrapped by the FHEVM library):allow(handle, address): Grants persistent access.allowTransient(handle, address): Grants temporary access for a single transaction.allowForDecryption(handle): Marks a handle as publicly decryptable.isAllowed(handle, address): Returns whether a given address has access.isSenderAllowed(handle): Checks if msg.sender is allowed to use a handle.They also emit:Allowed(handle, address)AllowedForDecryption(handle)These events are crucial for triggering coprocessor state updates and ensuring proper ACL replication to the Gateway.→ See the full guide of ACL.Security roleAlthough the FHE computation happens off-chain, host contracts play a critical role in protocol security by:Enforcing ACL-based gatingEnsuring only authorized contracts and users can decrypt or use a handlePreventing misuse of encrypted data (e.g., computation without access)Access attempts without proper authorization are rejected at the smart contract level, protecting both the integrity of confidential operations and user privacy.PreviousFHE libraryNextCoprocessorLast updated 3 months ago

This separation of powers ensures strong decentralization and auditability.Key responsibilitiesFHE threshold key generationThe KMS securely generates a global public/private key pair used across all host chains.This key enables composability — encrypted data can be shared between contracts and chains.The private FHE key is never directly accessible by a single party; instead, it is secret-shared among the MPC nodes.The system follows the NIST SP 800-57 key lifecycle model, managing key states such as Active, Suspended, Deactivated,and Destroyed to ensure proper rotation and forward security.Threshold Decryption via MPCThe KMS performs decryption using a threshold decryption protocol — at least a minimum number of MPC parties (e.g., 9 out of 13) must participate in the protocol to robustly decrypt a value.This protects against compromise: no individual party has access to the full key. And adversary would need to control more than the threshold of KMS nodes to influence the system.The protocol supports both:Public decryption (e.g., for smart contracts)User decryption (privately returned, re-encrypted only for the user to access)All decryption operation outputs are signed by each node and the output can be verified on-chain for full auditability.ZK Proof supportThe KMS generates Common Reference Strings (CRS) needed to validate Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPoK) when users submit encrypted values.This ensures encrypted inputs are valid and well-formed, and that a user has knowledge of the plaintext contained in the submitted input ciphertext.Security architectureMPC-based key sharingThe KMS currently uses 13 MPC nodes, operated by different reputable organizations.Private keys are split using threshold secret sharing.Communication between nodes are secured using mTLS with gRPC.Honest majority assumptionThe protocol is robust against malicious actors as long as at most 1/3 of the nodes act maliciously.It supports guaranteed output delivery even if some nodes are offline or misbehaving.Secure execution environmentsEach MPC node runs by default inside an AWS Nitro Enclave, a secure execution environment that prevents even node operators from accessing their own key shares. This design mitigates insider risks, such as unauthorized key reconstruction or selling of shares.Auditable via gatewayAll operations are broadcast through the Gateway and recorded as blockchain events.KMS responses are signed, allowing smart contracts and users to verify results cryptographically.Key lifecycle managementThe KMS adheres to a formal key lifecycle, as per NIST SP 800-57:Pre-activationKey is created but not in use.ActiveKey is used for encryption and decryption.SuspendedTemporarily replaced during rotation. Still usable for decryption.DeactivatedArchived; only used for decryption.CompromisedFlagged for misuse; only decryption allowed.DestroyedKey material is deleted permanently.The KMS supports key switching using FHE, allowing ciphertexts to be securely transferred between keys during rotation. This maintains interoperability across key updates.Backup & recoveryIn addition to robustness through MPC, the KMS also offers a custodial backup system:Each MPC node splits its key share into encrypted fragments, distributing them to independent custodians.If a share is lost, a quorum of custodians can collaboratively restore it, ensuring recovery even if several MPC nodes are offline.This approach guarantees business continuity and resilience against outages.All recovery operations require a quorum of operators and are fully auditable on-chain.Workflow example: Public decryptionA smart contract requests decryption via an oracle.The Gateway verifies permissions (i.e. that the contract is allowed to decrypt the ciphertext) and emits an event.KMS parties retrieve the ciphertext, verify it, and run the MPC decryption protocol to jointly compute the plaintext and sign their result.Once a quorum agrees on the plaintext result, it is published (with signatures).The oracle posts the plaintext back on-chain and contracts can verify the authenticity using the KMS signatures.PreviousGatewayNextRelayer & OracleLast updated 3 months ago

To learn how to use it in practice, see the Solidity Guides.What is FHEVM library?The FHEVM library enables developers to build smart contracts that operate on encrypted data—without requiring any knowledge of cryptography.It extends the standard Solidity development flow with:Encrypted data typesArithmetic, logical, and conditional operations on encrypted valuesFine-grained access controlSecure input handling and attestation supportThis library serves as an abstraction layer over Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and interacts seamlessly with off-chain components such as the Coprocessors and the Gateway.Key featuresEncrypted data typesThe library introduces encrypted variants of common Solidity types, implemented as user-defined value types. Internally, these are represented as bytes32 handles that point to encrypted values stored off-chain.BooleanseboolUnsigned integerseuint8, euint16, ..., euint256Signed integerseint8, eint16, ..., eint256Addresseseaddress→ See the full guide of Encrypted data types.FHE operationsEach encrypted type supports operations similar to its plaintext counterpart:Arithmetic: add, sub, mul, div, rem, negLogic: and, or, xor, notComparison: lt, gt, le, ge, eq, ne, min, maxBit manipulation: shl, shr, rotl, rotrThese operations are symbolically executed on-chain by generating new handles and emitting events for coprocessors to process the actual FHE computation off-chain.Example: euint64 result = FHE.mul(FHE.add(x, y), z);
return result;
}→ See the full guide of Operations on encrypted types.Branching with encrypted ConditionsDirect if or require statements are not compatible with encrypted booleans. Instead, the library provides a selectoperator to emulate conditional logic without revealing which branch was taken:euint64 result = FHE.select(condition, valueIfTrue, valueIfFalse);This preserves confidentiality even in conditional logic.→ See the full guide of Branching.Handling external encrypted inputsWhen users want to pass encrypted inputs (e.g., values they’ve encrypted off-chain or bridged from another chain), they provide:external valuesA list of coprocessor signatures (attestation)The function fromExternal is used to validate the attestation and extract a usable encrypted handle: euint64 val = FHE.fromExternal(param1, attestation);
ebool flag = FHE.fromExternal(param2, attestation);
}This ensures that only authorized, well-formed ciphertexts are accepted by smart contracts.→ See the full guide of Encrypted input.Access controlThe FHE library also exposes methods for managing access to encrypted values using the ACL maintained by host contracts:allow(handle, address): Grant persistent accessallowTransient(handle, address): Grant access for the current transaction onlyallowForDecryption(handle): Make handle publicly decryptableisAllowed(handle, address): Check if address has accessisSenderAllowed(handle): Shortcut for checking msg.sender permissionsThese allow methods emit events consumed by the coprocessors to replicate the ACL state in the Gateway.→ See the full guide of ACL.Pseudo-random encrypted valuesThe library allows generation of pseudo-random encrypted integers, useful for games, lotteries, or randomized logic:randEuintXX()randEuintXXBounded(uint bound)These are deterministic across coprocessors and indistinguishable to external observers.→ See the full guide of Generate random number.PreviousFHE on blockchainNextHost contractsLast updated 3 months ago

They act as lightweight services that interface with the Gateway, enabling smooth interaction with encrypted values—without requiring users or contracts to handle complex integration logic.These components are not part of the trusted base of the protocol; their actions are fully verifiable, and their misbehavior does not compromise confidentiality or correctness.Responsibilities of the OracleListen for on-chain decryption requests from contracts.Forward decryption requests to the Gateway on behalf of the contract.Wait for the KMS to produce signed plaintexts via the Gateway.Call back the contract on the host chain, passing the decrypted result.Since the decrypted values are signed by the KMS, the receiving smart contract can verify the result, removing any need
to trust the oracle itself.Security model of the OracleOracles are untrusted: they can only delay a request, not falsify it.All results are signed and verifiable on-chain.If one oracle fails to respond, another can take over.Goal: Enable contracts to access decrypted values asynchronously and securely, without embedding decryption logic.What is the Relayer?The Relayer is a user-facing service that simplifies interaction with the Gateway, particularly for encryption and
decryption operations that need to happen off-chain.Responsibilities of the RelayerSend encrypted inputs from the user to the Gateway for registration.Initiate user-side decryption requests, including EIP-712 authentication.Collect the response from the KMS, re-encrypted under the user’s public key.Deliver the ciphertext back to the user, who decrypts it locally in their browser/app.This allows users to interact with encrypted smart contracts without having to run their own Gateway interface,
validator, or FHE tooling.Security model of the RelayerRelayers are stateless and untrusted.All data flows are signed and auditable by the user.Users can always run their own relayer or interact with the Gateway directly if needed.Goal: Make it easy for users to submit encrypted inputs and retrieve private decrypted results without managing
infrastructure.How they fit inSmart contracts use the Oracle to receive plaintext results of encrypted computations via callbacks.Users rely on the Relayer to push encrypted values into the system and fetch personal decrypted results, all backed by
EIP-712 signatures and FHE key re-encryption.Together, Oracles and Relayers help bridge the gap between encrypted execution and application usability—without compromising security or decentralization.PreviousKMSNextRoadmapLast updated 3 months ago

# ERC7984 Tutorial | Protocol

ERC7984 Tutorial | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageERC7984 StandardERC7984 TutorialThis tutorial explains how to create a confidential fungible token using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and the OpenZeppelin smart contract library. By following this guide, you will learn how to build a token where balances and transactions remain encrypted while maintaining full functionality.Why FHE for confidential tokens?Confidential tokens make sense in many real-world scenarios:Privacy: Users can transact without revealing their exact balances or transaction amountsRegulatory Compliance: Maintains privacy while allowing for selective disclosure when neededBusiness Intelligence: Companies can keep their token holdings private from competitorsPersonal Privacy: Individuals can participate in DeFi without exposing their financial positionAudit Trail: All transactions are still recorded on-chain, just in encrypted formFHE enables these benefits by allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring privacy while maintaining the security and transparency of blockchain.Project SetupBefore starting this tutorial, ensure you have:Installed the FHEVM hardhat templateSet up the OpenZeppelin confidential contracts libraryFor help with these steps, refer to the following tutorial:Setting up OpenZeppelin confidential contractsUnderstanding the architectureOur confidential token will inherit from several key contracts:ERC7984 - OpenZeppelin's base for confidential tokensOwnable2Step - Access control for minting and administrative functionsSepoliaConfig - FHE configuration for the Sepolia testnetThe base smart contractLet's create our confidential token contract in contracts/ERC7984Example.sol. This contract will demonstrate the core functionality of ERC7984 tokens.A few key points about this implementation:The contract mints an initial supply with a clear (non-encrypted) amount during deploymentThe initial mint is done once during construction, establishing the token's total supplyAll subsequent transfers will be fully encrypted, preserving privacyThe contract inherits from ERC7984 for confidential token functionality and Ownable2Step for secure access controlWhile this example uses a clear initial mint for simplicity, in production you may want to consider:Using encrypted minting for complete privacy from genesisImplementing a more sophisticated minting scheduleOverriding some privacy assumptionspragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import {Ownable2Step, Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol";
import {FHE, externalEuint64, euint64} from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import {SepoliaConfig} from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
import {ERC7984} from "@openzeppelin/confidential-contracts/token/ERC7984.sol";
contract ERC7984Example is SepoliaConfig, ERC7984, Ownable2Step {
constructor(
address owner,
uint64 amount,
string memory name_,
string memory symbol_,
string memory tokenURI_
) ERC7984(name_, symbol_, tokenURI_) Ownable(owner) {
euint64 encryptedAmount = FHE.asEuint64(amount);
_mint(owner, encryptedAmount);
}
}Test workflowNow let's test the token transfer process. We'll create a test that:Encrypts a transfer amountSends tokens from owner to recipientVerifies the transfer was successful by checking balance handlesCreate a new file test/ERC7984Example.test.ts with the following test:import { ethers, fhevm } from 'hardhat';
describe('ERC7984Example', function () {
let token: any;
let owner: any;
let recipient: any;
let other: any;
const INITIAL_AMOUNT = 1000;
const TRANSFER_AMOUNT = 100;
beforeEach(async function () {
[owner, recipient, other] = await ethers.getSigners();
// Deploy ERC7984Example contract
token = await ethers.deployContract('ERC7984Example', [
owner.address,
INITIAL_AMOUNT,
'Confidential Token',
'CTKN',
'https://example.com/token'
]);
});
describe('Confidential Transfer Process', function () {
it('should transfer tokens from owner to recipient', async function () {
// Create encrypted input for transfer amount
const encryptedInput = await fhevm
.createEncryptedInput(await token.getAddress(), owner.address)
.add64(TRANSFER_AMOUNT)
.encrypt();
// Perform the confidential transfer
await expect(token
.connect(owner)
['confidentialTransfer(address,bytes32,bytes)'](
recipient.address,
encryptedInput.handles[0],
encryptedInput.inputProof
)).to.not.be.reverted;
// Check that both addresses have balance handles (without decryption for now)
const recipientBalanceHandle = await token.confidentialBalanceOf(recipient.address);
const ownerBalanceHandle = await token.confidentialBalanceOf(owner.address);
expect(recipientBalanceHandle).to.not.be.undefined;
expect(ownerBalanceHandle).to.not.be.undefined;
});
});
});To run the tests, use:Advanced features and extensionsThe basic ERC7984Example contract provides core functionality, but you can extend it with additional features. For example:Minting functionsVisible Mint - Allows the owner to mint tokens with a clear amount: _mint(to, FHE.asEuint64(amount));
}When to use: Prefer this for public/tokenomics-driven mints where transparency is desired (e.g., scheduled emissions).Privacy caveat: The minted amount is visible in calldata and events; use confidentialMint for privacy.Access control: Consider replacing onlyOwner with role-based access via AccessControl (e.g., MINTER_ROLE) for multi-signer workflows.Supply caps: If you need a hard cap, add a check before _mint and enforce it consistently for both visible and confidential flows.Confidential Mint - Allows minting with encrypted amounts for enhanced privacy: address to,
externalEuint64 encryptedAmount,
bytes calldata inputProof
) external onlyOwner returns (euint64 transferred) {
return _mint(to, FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof));
}Inputs: encryptedAmount and inputProof are produced off-chain with the SDK. Always validate and revert on malformed inputs.Gas considerations: Confidential operations cost more gas; batch mints sparingly and prefer fewer larger mints to reduce overhead.Auditing: While amounts stay private, you still get a verifiable audit trail of mints (timestamps, sender, recipient).Example (Hardhat SDK): .createEncryptedInput(await token.getAddress(), owner.address)
.add64(1_000)
.encrypt();
await token.confidentialMint(recipient.address, enc.handles[0], enc.inputProof);Burning functionsVisible Burn - Allows the owner to burn tokens with a clear amount: _burn(from, FHE.asEuint64(amount));
}Confidential Burn - Allows burning with encrypted amounts: address from,
externalEuint64 encryptedAmount,
bytes calldata inputProof
) external onlyOwner returns (euint64 transferred) {
return _burn(from, FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof));
}Authorization: Burning from arbitrary accounts is powerful; consider stronger controls (roles, multisig, timelocks) or user-consented burns.Event strategy: Decide whether to emit custom events revealing intent (not amounts) for better observability and offchain indexing.Error surfaces: Expect balance/allowance-like failures if encrypted amount exceeds balance; test both success and revert paths.Example (Hardhat SDK): .createEncryptedInput(await token.getAddress(), owner.address)
.add64(250)
.encrypt();
await token.confidentialBurn(holder.address, enc.handles[0], enc.inputProof);Total supply visibilityIf you want the owner to be able to view the total supply (useful for administrative purposes): transferred = super._update(from, to, amount);
FHE.allow(confidentialTotalSupply(), owner());
}What this does: Grants the owner permission to decrypt the latest total supply handle after every state-changing update.Operational model: The owner can call confidentialTotalSupply() and use their off-chain key material to decrypt the returned handle.Security considerations:If ownership changes, ensure only the new owner can decrypt going forward. With Ownable2Step, this function will automatically allow the current owner().Be mindful of compliance: granting supply visibility may be considered privileged access; document who holds the key and why.Alternatives: If you want organization-wide access, grant via a dedicated admin contract that holds decryption authority instead of a single EOA.PreviousERC7984 StandardNextERC7984 to ERC20 WrapperLast updated 23 days ago

# Sealed-bid auction tutorial | Protocol

Sealed-bid auction tutorial | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageSealed-bid auctionSealed-bid auction tutorialThis tutorial explains how to build a sealed-bid NFT auction using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). In this system, participants submit encrypted bids for a single NFT. Bids remain confidential during the auction, and only the winner’s information is revealed at the end.By following this guide, you will learn how to:Accept and process encrypted bidsCompare bids securely without revealing their valuesReveal the winner after the auction concludesDesign an auction that is private, fair, and transparentWhy FHEIn most onchain auctions, bids are fully public. Anyone can inspect the blockchain or monitor pending transactions to see how much each participant has bid. This breaks fairness as all it takes to win is to send a new bid with just one wei higher than the current highest.Existing solutions like commit-reveal schemes attempt to hide bids during a preliminary commit phase. However, they come with several drawbacks: increased transaction overhead, poor user experience (e.g., requiring users to send funds to EOA via CREATE2), and delays caused by the need for multiple auction phases.Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable participants to submit encrypted bids directly to a smart contract in a single step, eliminating multi-phase complexity, improving user experience, and preserving bid secrecy without ever revealing or decrypting them.Project SetupBefore starting this tutorial, ensure you have:Installed the FHEVM hardhat templateSet up the OpenZeppelin confidential contracts libraryDeployed your confidential tokenFor help with these steps, refer to these tutorials:Setting up OpenZeppelin confidential contractsDeploying a Confidential TokenCreate the smart contractsLet’s now create a new contract called BlindAuction.sol in the ./contracts/ folder. To enable FHE operations in our contract, we will need to inherit our contract from SepoliaConfig. This configuration provides the necessary parameters and network-specific settings required to interact with Zama’s FHEVM.Let’s also create some state variable that is going to be used in our auction. For the payment, we will rely on a ConfidentialFungibleToken. Indeed, we cannot use traditional ERC20, because even if the state in our auction is private, anyone can still monitor blockchain transactions and guess the bid value. By using a ConfidentialFungibleToken we ensure the amount stays hidden. This ConfidentialFungibleToken can be used with any ERC20, you will only need to wrap your token to hide future transfers.Our contract will also include an ERC721 token representing the NFT being auctioned and the address of the auction’s beneficiary. Finally, we’ll define some time-related parameters to control the auction’s duration.pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import { FHE, externalEuint64, euint64, ebool } from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
import {ConfidentialFungibleToken} from "@openzeppelin/confidential-contracts/token/ConfidentialFungibleToken.sol";
// ...
contract BlindAuction is SepoliaConfig {
/// @notice The recipient of the highest bid once the auction ends
address public beneficiary;
/// @notice Confidenctial Payment Token
ConfidentialFungibleToken public confidentialFungibleToken;
/// @notice Token for the auction
IERC721 public nftContract;
uint256 public tokenId;
/// @notice Auction duration
uint256 public auctionStartTime;
uint256 public auctionEndTime;
// ...
constructor(
address _nftContractAddress,
address _confidentialFungibleTokenAddress,
uint256 _tokenId,
uint256 _auctionStartTime,
uint256 _auctionEndTime
) {
beneficiary = msg.sender;
confidentialFungibleToken = ConfidentialFungibleToken(_confidentialFungibleTokenAddress);
nftContract = IERC721(_nftContractAddress);
// Transfer the NFT to the contract for the auction
nftContract.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenId);
require(_auctionStartTime < _auctionEndTime, "INVALID_TIME");
auctionStartTime = _auctionStartTime;
auctionEndTime = _auctionEndTime;
}
// ...
}Now, we need a way to store the highest bid and the potential winner. To store that information privately, we will use some tools provided by the FHE library. For storing an encrypted address, we can use eaddress type and for the highest bid, we can store the amount with euint64. Additionally, we can create a mapping to track the user bids.euint64 private highestBid;
eaddress private winningAddress;
/// @notice Mapping from bidder to their bid value
mapping(address account => euint64 bidAmount) private bids;As you may notice, in our code we are using euint64, which represents an encrypted 64-bit unsigned integer. Unlike standard Solidity type, where there is not that much difference between uint64 and uint256, in FHE the size of your data has a significant effect on performance. The larger the representation, the more expensive the computation becomes. That is for this reason, we recommend you to choose wisely your number representation based on your use case. Here for instance, euint64 is more than enough to handle token balance.Create our bid functionLet’s now create our bid function, where the user will transfer a confidential amount and send it to the auction smart contract. Since we want bids to remain private, users must first encrypt their bid amount locally. This encrypted value will then be used to securely transfer funds from the ConfidentialFungibleToken token that we’ve set as the payment method. We can create our function as follows: externalEuint64 encryptedAmount,
bytes calldata inputProof
) public onlyDuringAuction nonReentrant {
// Get and verify the amount from the user
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
// ...Here, we accept two parameters:Encrypted Amount: The user’s bid amount, encrypted using FHE.Input Proof: A Zero-Knowledge Proof ensuring the validity of the encrypted data.We can verify those parameters by using our helper function FHE.fromExternal() which gives us the reference to our encrypted amount.Then, we need to transfer the confidential token to the contract.confidentialFungibleToken.confidentialTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
euint64 balanceAfter = confidentialFungibleToken.confidentialBalanceOf(address(this));
euint64 sentBalance = FHE.sub(balanceAfter, balanceBefore);Notice that here, we are not using the amount provided by the user as a source of trust. Indeed, in case the user does not have enough funds, when calling the confidentialTransferFrom(), the transaction will not be reverted, but instead transfer silently a 0 value. This design choice protects eventual leaks as reverted transactions can unintentionally reveal some information on the data.Note: To dive deeper into how FHE works, each FHE operation done on chain will emit an event used to construct a computation graph. This graph is then executed by the Zama FHEVM. Thus, the FHE operation is not directly done on the smart contract side, but rather follows the source graph generated by it.Once the payment is done, we need to update the bid balance of the user. Notice here that the user can increase his previous bid if he wants:if (FHE.isInitialized(previousBid)) { // The user increase his bid
euint64 newBid = FHE.add(previousBid, sentBalance);
bids[msg.sender] = newBid;
} else {
// First bid for the user
bids[msg.sender] = sentBalance;
}And finally we can check if we need to update the encrypted winner:euint64 currentBid = bids[msg.sender];
FHE.allowThis(currentBid);
FHE.allow(currentBid, msg.sender);
if (FHE.isInitialized(highestBid)) {
ebool isNewWinner = FHE.lt(highestBid, currentBid);
highestBid = FHE.select(isNewWinner, currentBid, highestBid);
winningAddress = FHE.select(isNewWinner, FHE.asEaddress(msg.sender), winningAddress);
} else {
highestBid = currentBid;
winningAddress = FHE.asEaddress(msg.sender);
}
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
FHE.allowThis(winningAddress);As you can see here, we are using some FHE functions. Let’s talk a bit about the FHE.allow() and FHE.allowThis(). Each encrypted value has a restriction on who can read this value. To be able to access this value or even do some computation on it, we need to explicitly request access. This is the reason why we need to explicitly request the access. Here for instance, we want the contract and the user to have access to the bid value. However, only the contract can have access to the highest bid value and winner address that will be revealed at the end of the auction.Another point that we want to mention is the FHE.select() function. As mentioned previously, when using FHE, we do not want transactions to be reverted. Instead, when building our graph of FHE operation, we want to create two paths depending on an encrypted value. This is the reason we are using branching allowing us to define the type of process we want. Here for instance, if the bid value of the user is higher than the current one, we are going to change the amount and the address. However, if it is not the case, we are keeping the old one. This branching method is particularly useful, as on chain you cannot have access directly to encrypted data, but you still want to adapt your contract logic based on them.Alright, it seems our bidding function is ready. Here is the full code we have seen so far: // Get and verify the amount from the user
euint64 amount = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedAmount, inputProof);
// Transfer the confidential token as payment
euint64 balanceBefore = confidentialFungibleToken.confidentialBalanceOf(address(this));
FHE.allowTransient(amount, address(confidentialFungibleToken));
confidentialFungibleToken.confidentialTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
euint64 balanceAfter = confidentialFungibleToken.confidentialBalanceOf(address(this));
euint64 sentBalance = FHE.sub(balanceAfter, balanceBefore);
// Need to update the bid balance
euint64 previousBid = bids[msg.sender];
if (FHE.isInitialized(previousBid)) {
// The user increase his bid
euint64 newBid = FHE.add(previousBid, sentBalance);
bids[msg.sender] = newBid;
} else {
// First bid for the user
bids[msg.sender] = sentBalance;
}
// Compare the total value of the user from the highest bid
euint64 currentBid = bids[msg.sender];
FHE.allowThis(currentBid);
FHE.allow(currentBid, msg.sender);
if (FHE.isInitialized(highestBid)) {
ebool isNewWinner = FHE.lt(highestBid, currentBid);
highestBid = FHE.select(isNewWinner, currentBid, highestBid);
winningAddress = FHE.select(isNewWinner, FHE.asEaddress(msg.sender), winningAddress);
} else {
highestBid = currentBid;
winningAddress = FHE.asEaddress(msg.sender);
}
FHE.allowThis(highestBid);
FHE.allowThis(winningAddress);
}Auction resolution phaseOnce all participants have placed their bids, it’s time to move to the resolution phase, where we will need to reveal the winner address. First, we will need to decrypt the winner’s address as it is currently encrypted. To do so, we can use the DecryptionOracle provided by Zama. This oracle will be in charge of handling securely the decryption of an encrypted value and will return the result via a callback. To implement this, let's create a function that will call the DecryptionOracle: bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](1);
cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(winningAddress);
_latestRequestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.resolveAuctionCallback.selector);
}Here, we are requesting to decrypt a single parameter for the winningAddress. However, you can request multiple ones by increasing the cts array and adding other parameters.Notice also that when calling the FHE.requestDecryption(), we are passing a selector in the parameter. This selector will be the one called back by the oracle.Notice also that we have restricted this function to be called only when the auction has ended. We must not be able to call it while the auction is still running, else it will leak some information.We can now write our resolveAuctionCallback callback function: require(requestId == _latestRequestId, "Invalid requestId");
FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, cleartexts, decryptionProof);
(address resultWinnerAddress) = abi.decode(cleartexts, (address));
winnerAddress = resultWinnerAddress;
}cleartexts is the bytes array corresponding to the ABI encoding of all requested decrypted values, in this case abi.encode(winningAddress).To ensure that it is the expected data we are waiting for, we need to verify the requestId parameter and the signatures (included in the decryptionProof parameter), which verify the computation logic done. Once verified, we can update the winner’s address.Claiming rewards & refundsAlright, once the winner is revealed, we can now allow the winner to claim his reward and the other one to get refunded. require(winnerAddress == msg.sender, "Only winner can claim item");
require(!isNftClaimed, "NFT has already been claimed");
isNftClaimed = true;
// Reset bid value
bids[msg.sender] = FHE.asEuint64(0);
FHE.allowThis(bids[msg.sender]);
FHE.allow(bids[msg.sender], msg.sender);
// Transfer the highest bid to the beneficiary
FHE.allowTransient(highestBid, address(confidentialFungibleToken));
confidentialFungibleToken.confidentialTransfer(beneficiary, highestBid);
// Send the NFT to the winner
nftContract.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
} if (bidder == winnerAddress) revert TooLateError(auctionEndTime);
// Get the user bid value
euint64 amount = bids[bidder];
FHE.allowTransient(amount, address(confidentialFungibleToken));
// Reset user bid value
euint64 newBid = FHE.asEuint64(0);
bids[bidder] = newBid;
FHE.allowThis(newBid);
FHE.allow(newBid, bidder);
// Refund the user with his bid amount
confidentialFungibleToken.confidentialTransfer(bidder, amount);
}ConclusionIn this guide, we have walked through how to build a sealed-bid NFT auction using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) onchain.We demonstrated how FHE can be used to design a private and fair auction mechanism, keeping all bids encrypted and only revealing information when necessary.Now it’s your turn. Feel free to build on this code, extend it with more complex logic, or create your own decentralized application powered by FHE.PreviousSealed-bid auctionLast updated 12 days ago

# Public Decrypt single value | Protocol

Public Decrypt single value | ProtocolPowered by GitBookOn this pageDecryptionPublic Decrypt single valueThis example demonstrates the FHE public decryption mechanism with a single value.Public decryption is a mechanism that makes encrypted values visible to everyone once decrypted. Unlike user decryption where values remain private to authorized users, public decryption makes the data permanently visible to all participants. The public decryption call occurs onchain through smart contracts, making the decrypted value part of the blockchain's public state.To run this example correctly, make sure the files are placed in the following directories:.sol file → <your-project-root-dir>/contracts/.ts file → <your-project-root-dir>/test/This ensures Hardhat can compile and test your contracts as expected.PublicDecryptSingleValue.ts

# Linear models | Concrete ML

Linear models | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageLinear modelsThis page explains Concrete ML linear models for both classification and regression. These models are based on scikit-learn linear models.Supported models for encrypted inferenceThe following models are supported for training on clear data and predicting on encrypted data. Their API is similar to the one of scikit-learn. These models are also compatible with some of scikit-learn's main workflows, such as Pipeline() and GridSearch().LinearRegressionLinearRegressionLogisticRegressionLogisticRegressionLinearSVCLinearSVCLinearSVRLinearSVRPoissonRegressorPoissonRegressorTweedieRegressorTweedieRegressorGammaRegressorGammaRegressorLassoLassoRidgeRidgeElasticNetElasticNetSGDRegressorSGDRegressorSupported models for encrypted trainingIn addition to predicting on encrypted data, the following models support training on encrypted data.| SGDClassifier | SGDClassifier |Ciphertext format compatibilityThese models only support Concrete ciphertexts. See the ciphertexts format documentation for more details.Quantization parametersThe n_bits parameter controls the bit-width of the inputs and weights of the linear models. Linear models do not use table lookups and thus allows weight and inputs to be high precision integers.For models with input dimensions up to 300, the parameter n_bits can be set to 8 or more. When the input dimensions are larger, n_bits must be reduced to 6-7. In many cases, quantized models can preserve all performance metrics compared to the non-quantized float models from scikit-learn when n_bits is down to 6. You should validate accuracy on held-out test sets and adjust n_bits accordingly.For optimal results, you can use standard or min-max normalization to achieve a similar distribution of individual features. When there are many one-hot features, consider Principal Component Analysis as a pre-processing stage.For a more detailed comparison of the impact of such pre-processing, please refer to the logistic regression notebook.Pre-trained modelsYou can convert an already trained scikit-learn linear model to a Concrete ML one by using the from_sklearn_model method.

# Using Torch | Concrete ML

Using Torch | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageUsing TorchThis document explains how to implement machine learning models with Torch in Concrete ML, leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).IntroductionThere are two approaches to build FHE-compatible deep networks:Quantization Aware Training (QAT): This method requires using custom layers to quantize weights and activations to low bit-widths. Concrete ML works with Brevitas, a library that provides QAT support for PyTorch.Use compile_brevitas_qat_model to compile models in this mode.Post Training Quantization (PTQ): This method allows to compile a vanilla PyTorch model. However, accuracy may decrease significantly when quantizing weights and activations to fewer than 7 bits. On the other hand, depending on the model size, quantizing with 6-8 bits can be incompatible with FHE constraints. Thus you need to determine the trade-off between model accuracy and FHE compatibility.Use compile_torch_model to compile models in this mode.Both approaches require setting rounding_threshold_bits parameter accordingly. You should experiment to find the best values, starting with an initial value of 6. See here for more details.See the common compilation errors page for explanations and solutions to some common errors raised by the compilation function.Quantization Aware training (QAT)The following example uses a simple QAT PyTorch model that implements a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers. Due to its small size, making this model respect FHE constraints is relatively easy. To use QAT, Brevitas QuantIdentity nodes must be inserted in the PyTorch model, including one that quantizes the input of the forward function. brevitas.nn as qnn

self.fc2 = qnn.QuantLinear(n_hidden, n_hidden, True, weight_bit_width=n_bits, bias_quant=None)
self.quant3 = qnn.QuantIdentity(bit_width=n_bits, return_quant_tensor=True)
self.fc3 = qnn.QuantLinear(n_hidden, 2, True, weight_bit_width=n_bits, bias_quant=None)
def forward(self, x):

x = self.quant2(torch.relu(self.fc1(x)))
x = self.quant3(torch.relu(self.fc2(x)))
x = self.fc3(x)
return x
Once the model is trained, use compile_brevitas_qat_model from Concrete ML to perform conversion and compilation of the QAT network. Here, 3-bit quantization is used for both the weights and activations. This function automatically identifies the number of quantization bits used in the Brevitas model.import numpy
torch_input = torch.randn(100, N_FEAT)
torch_model = QATSimpleNet(30)
quantized_module = compile_brevitas_qat_model(
torch_model, # our model
torch_input, # a representative input-set to be used for both quantization and compilation
rounding_threshold_bits={"n_bits": 6, "method": "approximate"}
)
If QuantIdentity layers are missing for any input or intermediate value, the compile function will raise an error. See the common compilation errors page for an explanation.Post Training quantization (PTQ)The following example demonstrates a simple PyTorch model that implements a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers. The model is compiled with compile_torch_model to use FHE.import torch
N_FEAT = 12
n_bits = 6
class PTQSimpleNet(nn.Module):
def __init__(self, n_hidden):
super().__init__()
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(N_FEAT, n_hidden)
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(n_hidden, n_hidden)
self.fc3 = nn.Linear(n_hidden, 2)
def forward(self, x):
x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
x = self.fc3(x)
return x
from concrete.ml.torch.compile import compile_torch_model
import numpy
torch_input = torch.randn(100, N_FEAT)
torch_model = PTQSimpleNet(5)
quantized_module = compile_torch_model(
torch_model, # our model
torch_input, # a representative input-set to be used for both quantization and compilation
n_bits=6,
rounding_threshold_bits={"n_bits": 6, "method": "approximate"}
)Configuring quantization parametersThe quantization parameters, along with the number of neurons in each layer, determine the accumulator bit-width of the network. Larger accumulator bit-widths result in higher accuracy but slower FHE inference time.QAT: Configure parameters such as bit_width and weight_bit_width. Set n_bits=None in the compile_brevitas_qat_model.PTQ: Set the n_bits value in the compile_torch_model function. Manually determine the trade-off between accuracy, FHE compatibility, and latency.Running encrypted inferenceThe model can now perform encrypted inference.
y_pred = quantized_module.forward(x_test, fhe="execute")In this example, the input values x_test and the predicted values y_pred are floating points. The quantization (respectively de-quantization) step is done in the clear within the forward method, before (respectively after) any FHE computations.Simulated FHE Inference in the clearYou can perform the inference on clear data in order to evaluate the impact of quantization and of FHE computation on the accuracy of their model. See this section for more details.There are two approaches:quantized_module.forward(quantized_x, fhe="simulate"): This method simulates FHE execution taking into account Table Lookup errors. De-quantization must be done in a second step as for actual FHE execution. Simulation takes into account the p_error/global_p_error parametersquantized_module.forward(quantized_x, fhe="disable"): This method computes predictions in the clear on quantized data, and then de-quantize the result. The return value of this function contains the de-quantized (float) output of running the model in the clear. Calling this function on clear data is useful when debugging, but this does not perform actual FHE simulation.FHE simulation allows to measure the impact of the Table Lookup error on the model accuracy. You can adjust the Table Lookup error using p_error/global_p_error, as described in the approximate computation section.Supported operators and activationsConcrete ML supports a variety of PyTorch operators that can be used to build fully connected or convolutional neural networks, with normalization and activation layers.

# Set up the project | Concrete ML

*Source: concrete-ml/developers.html*

Set up the project | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSet up the projectConcrete ML is a Python library, so Python should be installed to develop Concrete ML. v3.8 and v3.9 are the only supported versions. Concrete ML also uses Poetry and Make.First of all, you need to git clone the project: clone https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-mlIn order to be able to run all documentation examples, we recommend to also install git-lfs and then pull the necessary files : lfs pullOn the contrary, to disable downloading all these files (which represents up to several hundreds of MB) when cloning the repository, simply run :=1 git clone https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-mlAutomatic installationA simple way to have everything installed is to use the development Docker (see the Docker setup guide). On Linux and macOS, you have to run the script in ./script/make_utils/setup_os_deps.sh. Specify the --linux-install-python flag if you want to install python3.8 as well on apt-enabled Linux distributions. The script should install everything you need for Docker and bare OS development (you can first review the content of the file to check what it will do).For Windows users, the setup_os_deps.sh script does not install dependencies because of how many different installation methods there are due to the lack of a single package manager.The first step is to install Python (as some of the dev tools depend on it), then Poetry. In addition to installing Python, you are still going to need the following software available on path on Windows, as some of the basic dev tools depend on them:git https://gitforwindows.org/jq https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releasesmake https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058#makeDevelopment on Windows only works with the Docker environment. Follow this link to setup the Docker environment.Manual installationPythonTo manually install Python, you can follow this guide (alternatively, you can google how to install Python 3.8 (or 3.9)).PoetryPoetry is used as the package manager. It drastically simplifies dependency and environment management. You can follow this official guide to install it.makeThe dev tools use make to launch various commands.On Linux, you can install make from your distribution's preferred package manager.On macOS, you can install a more recent version of make via brew:which gmake
# Set up the project | Concrete ML
brew install make
# Set up the project | Concrete ML
which gmakeIt is possible to install gmake as make. Check this StackOverflow post for more info.On Windows, check this GitHub gist.In the following sections, be sure to use the proper make tool for your system: make, gmake, or other.Cloning the repositoryTo get the source code of Concrete ML, clone the code repository using the link for your favorite communication protocol (ssh or https).Setting up environment on your host OSWe are going to make use of virtual environments. This helps to keep the project isolated from other Python projects in the system. The following commands will create a new virtual environment under the project directory and install dependencies to it.The following command will not work on Windows if you don't have Poetry >= 1.2.make setup_envActivating the environmentFinally, activate the newly created environment using the following command:macOS or LinuxWindowsSetting up environment on DockerDocker automatically creates and sources a venv in ~/dev_venv/The venv persists thanks to volumes. It also creates a volume for ~/.cache to speedup later reinstallations. You can check which Docker volumes exist with:You can still run all make commands inside Docker (to update the venv, for example). Be mindful of the current venv being used (the name in parentheses at the beginning of your command prompt).(dev_venv) dev_user@8e299b32283c:/src$ make setup_envLeaving the environmentAfter your work is done, you can simply run the following command to leave the environment:Syncing environment with the latest changesFrom time to time, new dependencies will be added to the project or the old ones will be removed. The command below will make sure the project has the proper environment, so run it regularly!Troubleshooting your environmentin your OSIf you are having issues, consider using the dev Docker exclusively (unless you are working on OS-specific bug fixes or features).Here are the steps you can take on your OS to try and fix issues:make setup_env

# Security and correctness | Concrete ML

Security and correctness | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSecurity and correctnessSecurity modelThe default parameters for Concrete ML are chosen considering the IND-CPA security model, and are selected with a bootstrapping off-by-one error probability of 2−402^-402−40. In particular, it is assumed that the results of decrypted computations are not shared by the secret key owner with any third parties, as such an action can lead to leakage of the secret encryption key. If you are designing an application where decryptions must be shared, you will need to craft custom encryption parameters which are chosen in consideration of the IND-CPA^D security model [1].Correctness of computationsThe cryptography concepts section explains how Concrete ML can ensure guaranteed correctness of encrypted computations. In this approach, a quantized machine learning model will be converted to an FHE circuit that produces the same result on encrypted data as the original model on clear data.However, the bootstrapping off-by-one error probability can be configured by the user. Raising this probability results in lower latency when executing on encrypted data, but higher values cancel the correctness guarantee of the default setting. In practice this may not be an issue, as the accuracy of the model may be maintained, even though slight differences are observed in the model outputs. Moreover, as noted in the paragraph above, raising the off-by-one error probability may negatively impact the security model.Furthermore, a second approach to reduce latency at the expense of correctness is approximate computation of univariate functions. This mode is enabled by using the rounding setting. When using the fhe.Exactness.APPROXIMATE rounding method, off-by-one errors are always induced in the computation of activation functions, irrespective of the bootstrapping off-by-one error probability.When trading-off better latency for correctness, it is highly recommended to use the FHE simulation feature to measure accuracy on a drawn-out test-set. In many cases the accuracy of the model is only slightly impacted by approximate computations.References[1] Li, Baiyu, et al. “Securing approximate homomorphic encryption using differential privacy.” Annual International Cryptology Conference.

# What is Concrete ML? | Concrete ML

*Source: concrete-ml/get-started.html*

What is Concrete ML? | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageWhat is Concrete ML?Concrete ML is an open source, privacy-preserving, machine learning framework based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It enables data scientists without any prior knowledge of cryptography to perform:Automatic model conversion: Use familiar APIs from scikit-learn and PyTorch to convert machine learning models to their FHE equivalent. This is applicable for linear models, tree-based models, and neural networks).Encrypted data training: Train linear models or fine-tune LLMs directly on encrypted data to maintain privacy.Encrypted data pre-processing: Pre-process encrypted data using a DataFrame paradigm.Key featuresModel inference on encrypted data: Concrete ML converts models such as decision trees, LLMs, neural networks, etc.. to predict on encrypted data. Those models can be trained either on clear data or on encrypted data.Training on encrypted data: FHE is an encryption technique that allows computing directly on encrypted data, without needing to decrypt it. With FHE, you can build private-by-design applications without compromising on features. Learn more about FHE in this introduction or join the FHE.org community.Federated learning: Training on encrypted data provides the highest level of privacy but is slower than training on clear data. Federated learning is an alternative approach, where data privacy can be ensured by using a trusted gradient aggregator, coupled with optional differential privacy instead of encryption. Concrete ML can import all types of models: linear, tree-based and neural networks, that are trained using federated learning using the from_sklearn_model function and the compile_torch_model function.Example usageHere is a simple example of classification on encrypted data using logistic regression. You can find more examples here.This example shows the typical flow of a Concrete ML model:Training the model: Train the model on unencrypted (plaintext) data using scikit-learn. Since Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) operates over integers, Concrete ML quantizes the model to use only integers during inference.Compiling the model: Compile the quantized model to an FHE equivalent. Under the hood, the model is first converted to a Concrete Python program and then compiled.Performing inference: Perform inference on encrypted data. The example above shows encrypted inference in the model-development phase. Alternatively, during deployment in a client/server setting, the client encrypts the data, the server processes it securely, and then the client decrypts the results.from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

print("Probability with `predict_proba`: ", y_proba_fhe)
print("Probability with encrypt/run/decrypt calls: ", y0)Current limitationsPrecision and accuracy: In order to run models in FHE, Concrete ML requires models to be within the precision limit, currently 16-bit integers. Thus, machine learning models must be quantized and it sometimes leads to a loss of accuracy versus the original model that operates on plaintext.Models availability: Concrete ML currently only supports training on encrypted data for some models, while it supports inference for a large variety of models.Processing: Concrete currently doesn't support pre-processing model inputs and post-processing model outputs. These processing stages may involve:Text-to-numerical feature transformationDimensionality reductionKNN or clusteringFeaturizationNormalizationThe mixing of ensemble models' results.These issues are currently being addressed, and significant improvements are expected to be released in the near future.Concrete stackConcrete ML is built on top of Zama's Concrete.Online demos and tutorialsVarious tutorials are available for built-in models and deep learning.

# Inference | Concrete ML

Inference | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageInferenceLLMs can be converted to use FHE to generate encrypted tokens based on encrypted prompts. Concrete ML implements LLM inference as a client/server protocol whereThe client executes non-linear layers in the LLM, such as attention and activation functions.The server executes linear layers, such as projection and embedding.The FHE LLM implementation in Concrete ML has the following characteristics:Data transfer is necessary for each linear layer. The size of encrypted data
is about 4x the size of the clear data that are input/outputs to the linear layers. For instance:A LLAMA 1B model exchanges around 18MB of data per token.A GPT2 mode exchanges around 2.2MB of data per token.The client machine needs to perform some computation, thus it needs to execute some PyTorch layers.Advantages of FHE include:Offloading computation from clients with limited hardware.Preserving intellectual property by running sensitive model components on encrypted data.Compiling an LLM for FHE InferenceThis document introduces how to use Concrete ML to run encrypted LLM inference with FHE.

# Advanced features | Concrete ML

*Source: concrete-ml/explanations/advanced_features.html*

Advanced features | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresConcrete ML provides features for advanced users to adjust cryptographic parameters generated by the Concrete stack. This allows users to identify the best trade-off between latency and performance for their specific machine learning models.Approximate computationsConcrete ML makes use of table lookups (TLUs) to represent any non-linear operation (e.g., a sigmoid). TLUs are implemented through the Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) operation, which applies a non-linear operation in the cryptographic realm.The result of TLU operations is obtained with a specific tolerance to off-by-one errors. Concrete ML offers the possibility to set the probability of such errors occurring, which influences the cryptographic parameters. The lower the tolerance, the more restrictive the parameters become, making both key generation and, more significantly, FHE execution time slower.Concrete ML has a simulation mode where the impact of approximate computation of TLUs on the model accuracy can be determined. The simulation is much faster, speeding up model development significantly. The behavior in simulation mode is representative of the behavior of the model on encrypted data.In Concrete ML, there are three different ways to define the tolerance to off-by-one errors for each TLU operation:setting p_error, the error probability of an individual TLU (see here)setting global_p_error, the error probability of the full circuit (see here)not setting p_error nor global_p_error, and using default parameters (see here)p_error and global_p_error cannot be set at the same time, as they are incompatible with each other.Tolerance to off-by-one error for an individual TLUThe first way to set error probabilities in Concrete ML is at the local level, by directly setting the tolerance to error of each individual TLU operation (such as activation functions for a neuron output). This tolerance is referred to as p_error. A given PBS operation has a 1 - p_error chance of being correct 100% of the time. The successful evaluation here means that the value decrypted after FHE evaluation is exactly the same as the one that would be computed in the clear. Otherwise, off-by-one errors might occur, but, in practice, these errors are not necessarily problematic if they are sufficiently rare.For simplicity, it is best to use default options, irrespective of the type of model. Especially for deep neural networks, default values may be too pessimistic, reducing computation speed without any improvement in accuracy. For deep neural networks, some TLU errors might not affect the accuracy of the network, so p_error can be safely increased (e.g., see CIFAR classifications in our showcase).Here is a visualization of the effect of the p_error on a neural network model with a p_error = 0.1 compared to execution in the clear (i.e., no error):Impact of p_error in a Neural NetworkVarying p_error in the one hidden-layer neural network above produces the following inference times. Increasing p_error to 0.1 halves the inference time with respect to a p_error of 0.001. In the graph above, the decision boundary becomes noisier with a higher p_error.0.0010.800.010.410.10.37The speedup depends on model complexity, but, in an iterative approach, it is possible to search for a good value of p_error to obtain a speedup while maintaining good accuracy. Concrete ML provides a tool to find a good value for p_error based on binary search.Users have the possibility to change this p_error by passing an argument to the compile function of any of the models. Here is an example:from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, class_sep=2, n_features=4, random_state=42)
# Advanced features | Concrete ML
X_train, _, y_train, _ = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=10, random_state=42)
clf = XGBClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Advanced features | Concrete ML
clf.compile(X_train, p_error=0.1)If the p_error value is specified and simulation is enabled, the run will take into account the randomness induced by the choice of p_error. This results in statistical similarity to the FHE evaluation.A global tolerance for one-off-errors for the entire modelA global_p_error is also available and defines the probability of 100% correctness for the entire model, compared to execution in the clear. In this case, the p_error for every TLU is determined internally in Concrete such that the global_p_error is reached for the whole model.There might be cases where the user encounters a No cryptography parameter found error message. Increasing the p_error or the global_p_error in this case might help.Usage is similar to the p_error parameter:clf.compile(X_train, global_p_error=0.1)In the above example, XGBoostClassifier in FHE has a 1/10 probability to have a one-off output value compared to the expected value. The shift is relative to the expected value, so even if the result is different, it should be close to the expected value.Using default error probabilityIf neither p_error or global_p_error are set, Concrete ML employs p_error = 2^-40 by default.Searching for the best error probabilityCurrently finding a good p_error value a-priori is not possible, as it is difficult to determine the impact of the TLU error on the output of a neural network. Concrete ML provides a tool to find a good p_error value that improves inference speed while maintaining accuracy. The method is based on binary search and evaluates the latency/accuracy trade-off iteratively.

# Compilation | Concrete ML

Compilation | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCompilationCompilation of a model produces machine code that executes the model on encrypted data. In some cases, notably in the client/server setting, the compilation can be done by the server when loading the model for serving.As FHE execution is much slower than execution on non-encrypted data, Concrete ML has a simulation mode which can help to quickly evaluate the impact of FHE execution on models.Compilation to FHEConcrete ML implements model inference using Concrete as a backend. In order to execute in FHE, a numerical program written in Concrete needs to be compiled. This functionality is described here, and Concrete ML hides away most of the complexity of this step, completing the entire compilation process itself.From the perspective of the Concrete ML user, the compilation process performed by Concrete can be broken up into 3 steps:tracing the NumPy program and creating a Concrete op-graphchecking the op-graph for FHE compatibilityproducing machine code for the op-graph (this step automatically determines cryptographic parameters)Additionally, the client/server API packages the result of the last step in a way that allows the deployment of the encrypted circuit to a server, as well as key generation, encryption, and decryption on the client side.Built-in modelsCompilation is performed for built-in models with the compile method :.compile(X_train)scikit-learn pipelinesWhen using a pipeline, the Concrete ML model can predict with FHE during the pipeline execution, but it needs to be compiled beforehand.

This is not secure, but it is much faster than executing in FHE. This mode is useful for debugging, especially when looking for appropriate model hyper-parametersverification of the maximum bit-width of the op-graph and the intermediary bit-widths of model layers, to evaluate their impact on FHE execution latencySimulation is enabled for all Concrete ML models once they are compiled as shown above. Obtaining the simulated predictions of the models is done by setting the fhe="simulate" argument to prediction methods:Moreover, the maximum accumulator bit-width is determined as follows:A simple Concrete exampleWhile Concrete ML hides away all the Concrete code that performs model inference, it can be useful to understand how Concrete code works. Here is a toy example for a simple linear regression model on integers to illustrate compilation concepts.

# Pruning | Concrete ML

Pruning | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pagePruningPruning is a method to reduce neural network complexity, usually applied in order to reduce the computation cost or memory size. Pruning is used in Concrete ML to control the size of accumulators in neural networks, thus making them FHE-compatible. See here for an explanation of accumulator bit-width constraints.Overview of pruning in Concrete MLPruning is used in Concrete ML for two types of neural networks:Built-in neural networks include a pruning mechanism that can be parameterized by the user. The pruning type is based on L1-norm. To comply with FHE constraints, Concrete ML uses unstructured pruning, as the aim is not to eliminate neurons or convolutional filters completely, but to decrease their accumulator bit-width.Custom neural networks, to work well under FHE constraints, should include pruning. When implemented with PyTorch, you can use the framework's pruning mechanism (e.g., L1-Unstructured) to good effect.Basics of pruningIn neural networks, a neuron computes a linear combination of inputs and learned weights, then applies an activation function.Artificial NeuronThe neuron computes:yk=ϕ(∑iwixi)y_k = \phi\left(\sum_i w_ix_i\right)yk​=ϕ(∑i​wi​xi​)When building a full neural network, each layer will contain multiple neurons, which are connected to the inputs or to the neuron outputs of a previous layer.Fully Connected Neural NetworkFor every neuron shown in each layer of the figure above, the linear combinations of inputs and learned weights are computed. Depending on the values of the inputs and weights, the sum vk=∑iwixiv_k = \sum_i w_ix_ivk​=∑i​wi​xi​ - which for Concrete ML neural networks is computed with integers - can take a range of different values.To respect the bit-width constraint of the FHE table lookup, the values of the accumulator vkv_kvk​ must remain small to be representable using a maximum of 16 bits. In other words, the values must be between 0 and 216−12^{16}-1216−1.Pruning a neural network entails fixing some of the weights wkw_kwk​ to be zero during training. This is advantageous to meet FHE constraints, as irrespective of the distribution of xix_ixi​, multiplying these input values by 0 does not increase the accumulator value.Fixing some of the weights to 0 makes the network graph look more similar to the following:Pruned Fully Connected Neural NetworkWhile pruning weights can reduce the prediction performance of the neural network, studies show that a high level of pruning (above 50%) can often be applied. See here how Concrete ML uses pruning in Fully Connected Neural Networks.Pruning in practiceIn the formula above, in the worst case, the maximum number of the input and weights that can make the result exceed nnn bits is given by:Ω=floor(2nmax−1(2nweights−1)(2ninputs−1))\Omega = \mathsf{floor} \left( \frac{2^{n_{\mathsf{max}}} - 1}{(2^{n_{\mathsf{weights}}} - 1)(2^{n_{\mathsf{inputs}}} - 1)} \right)Ω=floor((2nweights​−1)(2ninputs​−1)2nmax​−1​)Here, nmax=16n_{\mathsf{max}} = 16nmax​=16 is the maximum precision allowed.For example, if nweights=2n_{\mathsf{weights}} = 2nweights​=2 and ninputs=2n_{\mathsf{inputs}} = 2ninputs​=2 with nmax=16n_{\mathsf{max}} = 16nmax​=16, the worst case scenario occurs when all inputs and weights are equal to their maximal value 22−1=32^2-1=322−1=3. There can be at most Ω=7281\Omega = 7281Ω=7281 elements in the multi-sums.The distribution of the weights of a neural network is Gaussian, with many weights either 0 or having a small value. This enables exceeding the worst case number of active neurons without having to risk overflowing the bit-width. In built-in neural networks, the parameter n_hidden_neurons_multiplier is multiplied with Ω\OmegaΩ to determine the total number of non-zero weights that should be kept in a neuron.PreviousQuantizationNextCompilationLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Quantization | Concrete ML

*Source: concrete-ml/explanations/quantization.html*

Quantization | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageQuantizationQuantization is the process of constraining an input from a continuous or otherwise large set of values (such as real numbers) to a discrete set (such as integers).This means that some accuracy in the representation is lost (e.g., a simple approach is to eliminate least-significant bits). In many cases in machine learning, it is possible to adapt the models to give meaningful results while using these smaller data types. This significantly reduces the number of bits necessary for intermediary results during the execution of these machine learning models.Since FHE is currently limited to 16-bit integers, it is necessary to quantize models to make them compatible. As a general rule, the smaller the bit-width of integer values used in models, the better the FHE performance. This trade-off should be taken into account when designing models, especially neural networks.Overview of quantization in Concrete MLQuantization implemented in Concrete ML is applied in two ways:Built-in models apply quantization internally and the user only needs to configure some quantization parameters. This approach requires little work by the user but may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for all types of models. The final quantized model is FHE-friendly and ready to predict over encrypted data. In this setting, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is used for linear models, data quantization is used for tree-based models and, finally, Quantization Aware Training (QAT) is included in the built-in neural network models.For custom neural networks with more complex topology, obtaining FHE-compatible models with good accuracy requires QAT. Concrete ML offers the possibility for the user to perform quantization before compiling to FHE. This can be achieved through a third-party library that offers QAT tools, such as Brevitas for PyTorch. In this approach, the user is responsible for implementing a full-integer model, respecting FHE constraints. Please refer to the advanced QAT tutorial for tips on designing FHE neural networks.While Concrete ML quantizes machine learning models, the data that the client has is often in floating point. Concrete ML models provide APIs to quantize inputs and de-quantize outputs.Note that the floating point input is quantized in the clear, meaning it is converted to integers before being encrypted. The model's outputs are also integers and decrypted before de-quantization.Basics of quantizationLet [α,β][\alpha, \beta ][α,β] be the range of a value to quantize where α\alphaα is the minimum and β\betaβ is the maximum. To quantize a range of floating point values (in R\mathbb{R}R) to integer values (in Z\mathbb{Z}Z), the first step is to choose the data type that is going to be used. Many ML models work with weights and activations represented as 8-bit integers, so this will be the value used in this example. Knowing the number of bits that can be used for a value in the range [α,β][\alpha, \beta ][α,β], the scale SSS can be computed :S=β−α2n−1S = \frac{\beta - \alpha}{2^n - 1}S=2n−1β−α​where nnn is the number of bits (n≤8n \leq 8n≤8). In the following, n=8n = 8n=8 is assumed.In practice, the quantization scale is then S=β−α255S = \frac{\beta - \alpha}{255}S=255β−α​. This means the gap between consecutive representable values cannot be smaller than SSS, which, in turn, means there can be a substantial loss of precision. Every interval of length SSS will be represented by a value within the range [0..255][0..255][0..255].The other important parameter from this quantization schema is the zero point ZpZ_pZp​ value. This essentially brings the 0 floating point value to a specific integer. If the quantization scheme is asymmetric (quantized values are not centered in 0), the resulting ZpZ_pZp​ will be in Z\mathbb{Z}Z.Zp=round(−αS)Z_p = \mathtt{round} \left(- \frac{\alpha}{S} \right)Zp​=round(−Sα​)When using quantized values in a matrix multiplication or convolution, the equations for computing the result become more complex. The IntelLabs Distiller documentation provides a more detailed explanation of the maths used to quantize values and how to keep computations consistent.Quantization special casesMachine learning acceleration solutions are often based on integer computation of activations. To make quantization computations hardware-friendly, a popular approach is to ensure that scales are powers-of-two, which allows the replacement of the division in the equations above with a shift-right operation. TFHE also has a fast primitive for right bit-shift that enables acceleration in the special case of power-of-two scales.Configuring model quantization parametersBuilt-in models provide a simple interface for configuring quantization parameters, most notably the number of bits used for inputs, model weights, intermediary values, and output values.For linear models, the quantization is done post-training. Thus, the model is trained in floating point, and then, the best integer weight representations are found, depending on the distribution of inputs and weights. For these models, the user selects the value of the n_bits parameter.For linear models, n_bits is used to quantize both model inputs and weights. Depending on the number of features, you can use a single integer value for the n_bits parameter (e.g., a value between 2 and 7). When the number of features is high, the n_bits parameter should be decreased if you encounter compilation errors. It is also possible to quantize inputs and weights with different numbers of bits by passing a dictionary to n_bits containing the op_inputs and op_weights keys.For tree-based models, the training and test data is quantized. The maximum accumulator bit-width for a model trained with n_bits=n for this type of model is known beforehand: It will need n+1 bits. Through experimentation, it was determined that, in many cases, a value of 5 or 6 bits gives the same accuracy as training in floating point and values above n=7 do not increase model performance (but rather induce a strong slowdown).Tree-based models can directly control the accumulator bit-width used. If 6 or 7 bits are not sufficient to obtain good accuracy on your data-set, one option is to use an ensemble model (RandomForest or XGBoost) and increase the number of trees in the ensemble. This, however, will have a detrimental impact on FHE execution speed.For built-in neural networks, several linear layers are used. Thus, the outputs of a layer are used as inputs to a new layer. Built-in neural networks use Quantization Aware Training. The parameters controlling the maximum accumulator bit-width are the number of weights and activation bits ( module__n_w_bits, module__n_a_bits ), but also the pruning factor. This factor is determined automatically by specifying a desired accumulator bit-width module__n_accum_bits and, optionally, a multiplier factor, module__n_hidden_neurons_multiplier.For built-in neural networks, the maximum accumulator bit-width cannot be precisely controlled. To use many input features and a high number of bits is beneficial for model accuracy, but it can conflict with the 16-bit accumulator constraint. Finding the best quantization parameters to maximize accuracy, while keeping the accumulator size down, can only be accomplished through experimentation.Quantizing model inputs and outputsThe models implemented in Concrete ML provide features to let the user quantize the input data and de-quantize the output data.In a client/server setting, the client is responsible for quantizing inputs before sending them, encrypted, to the server. The client must then de-quantize the encrypted integer results received from the server. See the Production Deployment section for more details.Here is a simple example showing how to perform inference, starting from float values and ending up with float values.

The list of supported models can be found in the Hummingbird documentation.Concrete ML allows the conversion of an ONNX inference to NumPy inference (note that NumPy is always the entry point to run models in FHE with Concrete ML).Hummingbird exposes a convert function that can be imported as follows from the hummingbird.ml package:

It is possible to add hooks during the training phase, for example once an epoch is finished.skorch allows the user to easily create a classifier or regressor around a neural network (NN), implemented in Torch as a nn.Module, which is used by Concrete ML to provide a fully-connected, multi-layer NN with a configurable number of layers and optional pruning (see pruning and the neural network documentation for more information).Under the hood, Concrete ML uses a skorch wrapper around a single PyTorch module, SparseQuantNeuralNetwork. More information can be found in the API guide. """Sparse Quantized Neural Network classifier.BrevitasBrevitas is a quantization aware learning toolkit built on top of PyTorch. It provides quantization layers that are one-to-one equivalents to PyTorch layers, but also contain operations that perform the quantization during training.While Brevitas provides many types of quantization, for Concrete ML, a custom "mixed integer" quantization applies. This "mixed integer" quantization is much simpler than the "integer only" mode of Brevitas. The "mixed integer" network design is defined as:all weights and activations of convolutional, linear and pooling layers must be quantized (e.g., using Brevitas layers, QuantConv2D, QuantAvgPool2D, QuantLinear)PyTorch floating-point versions of univariate functions can be used (e.g., torch.relu, nn.BatchNormalization2D, torch.max (encrypted vs. constant), torch.add, torch.exp). See the PyTorch supported layers page for a full list.The "mixed integer" mode used in Concrete ML neural networks is based on the "integer only" Brevitas quantization that makes both weights and activations representable as integers during training. However, through the use of lookup tables in Concrete ML, floating point univariate PyTorch functions are supported.For "mixed integer" quantization to work, the first layer of a Brevitas nn.Module must be a QuantIdentity layer. However, you can then use functions such as torch.sigmoid on the result of such a quantizing operation.

FHE Op-graph design | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageProject architectureFHE Op-graph designThe ONNX import section gave an overview of the conversion of a generic ONNX graph to an FHE-compatible Concrete ML op-graph. This section describes the implementation of operations in the Concrete ML op-graph and the way floating point can be used in some parts of the op-graphs through table lookup operations.Float vs. quantized operationsConcrete, the underlying implementation of TFHE that powers Concrete ML, enables two types of operations on integers:arithmetic operations: the addition of two encrypted values and multiplication of encrypted values with clear scalars. These are used, for example, in dot-products, matrix multiplication (linear layers), and convolution.table lookup operations (TLU): using an encrypted value as an index, return the value of a lookup table at that index. This is implemented using Programmable Bootstrapping. This operation is used to perform any non-linear computation such as activation functions, quantization, and normalization.Since machine learning models use floating point inputs and weights, they first need to be converted to integers using quantization.Alternatively, it is possible to use a table lookup to avoid the quantization of the entire graph, by converting floating-point ONNX subgraphs into lambdas and computing their corresponding lookup tables to be evaluated directly in FHE. This operator-fusion technique only requires the input and output of the lambdas to be integers.For example, in the following graph there is a single input, which must be an encrypted integer tensor. The following series of univariate functions is then fed into a matrix multiplication (MatMul) and fused into a single table lookup with integer inputs and outputs.ONNX operationsConcrete ML implements ONNX operations using Concrete, which can handle floating point operations, as long as they can be fused to an integer lookup table. The ONNX operations implementations are based on the QuantizedOp class.There are two modes of creation of a single table lookup for a chain of ONNX operations:float mode: when the operation can be fusedmixed float/integer: when the ONNX operation needs to perform arithmetic operationsThus, QuantizedOp instances may need to quantize their inputs or the result of their computation, depending on their position in the graph.The QuantizedOp class provides a generic implementation of an ONNX operation, including the quantization of inputs and outputs, with the computation implemented in NumPy in ops_impl.py. It is possible to picture the architecture of the QuantizedOp as the following structure:This figure shows that the QuantizedOp has a body that implements the computation of the operation, following the ONNX spec. The operation's body can take either integer or float inputs and can output float or integer values. Two quantizers are attached to the operation: one that takes float inputs and produces integer inputs and one that does the same for the output.Operations that can fuse to a TLUDepending on the position of the op in the graph and its inputs, the QuantizedOp can be fully fused to a TLU.Many ONNX ops are trivially univariate, as they multiply variable inputs with constants or apply univariate functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, etc. This includes operations between the input and the MatMul in the graph above (subtraction, comparison, multiplication, etc. between inputs and constants).Operations that work on integersOperations, such as matrix multiplication of encrypted inputs with a constant matrix or convolution with constant weights, require that the encrypted inputs be integers. In this case, the input quantizer of the QuantizedOp is applied. These types of operations are implemented with a class that derives from QuantizedOp and implements q_impl, such as QuantizedGemm and QuantizedConv.Operations that produce graph outputsFinally, some operations produce graph outputs, which must be integers. These operations need to quantize their outputs as follows:The diagram above shows that both float ops and integer ops need to quantize their outputs to integers when placed at the end of the graph.Putting it all togetherTo chain the operation types described above following the ONNX graph, Concrete ML constructs a function that calls the q_impl of the QuantizedOp instances in the graph in sequence, and uses Concrete to trace the execution and compile to FHE. Thus, in this chain of function calls, all groups of that instruction that operate in floating point will be fused to TLUs. In FHE, this lookup table is computed with a PBS.The red contours show the groups of elementary Concrete instructions that will be converted to TLUs.Note that the input is slightly different from the QuantizedOp. Since the encrypted function takes integers as inputs, the input needs to be de-quantized first.Implementing a QuantizedOpQuantizedOp is the base class for all ONNX-quantized operators. It abstracts away many things to allow easy implementation of new quantized ops.Determining if the operation can be fusedThe QuantizedOp class exposes a function can_fuse that:helps to determine the type of implementation that will be traced.determines whether operations further in the graph, that depend on the results of this operation, can fuse.In most cases, ONNX ops have a single variable input and one or more constant inputs.When the op implements element-wise operations between the inputs and constants (addition, subtract, multiplication, etc), the operation can be fused to a TLU. Thus, by default in QuantizedOp, the can_fuse function returns True.When the op implements operations that mix the various scalars in the input encrypted tensor, the operation cannot fuse, as table lookups are univariate. Thus, operations such as QuantizedGemm and QuantizedConv return False in can_fuse.Some operations may be found in both settings above. A mechanism is implemented in Concrete ML to determine if the inputs of a QuantizedOp are produced by a unique integer tensor. Therefore, the can_fuse function of some QuantizedOp types (addition, subtraction) will allow fusion to take place if both operands are produced by a unique integer tensor: return len(self._int_input_names) == 1Case 1: A floating point version of the op is sufficientYou can check ops_impl.py to see how some operations are implemented in NumPy. The declaration convention for these operations is as follows:The required inputs should be positional arguments only before the /, which marks the limit of the positional arguments.The optional inputs should be positional or keyword arguments between the / and *, which marks the limits of positional or keyword arguments.The operator attributes should be keyword arguments only after the *.The proper use of positional/keyword arguments is required to allow the QuantizedOp class to properly populate metadata automatically. It uses Python inspect modules and stores relevant information for each argument related to its positional/keyword status. This allows using the Concrete implementation as specifications for QuantizedOp, which removes some data duplication and generates a single source of truth for QuantizedOp and ONNX-NumPy implementations.In that case (unless the quantized implementation requires special handling like QuantizedGemm), you can just set _impl_for_op_named to the name of the ONNX op for which the quantized class is implemented (this uses the mapping ONNX_OPS_TO_NUMPY_IMPL in onnx_utils.py to get the correct implementation).Case 2: An integer implementation of the op is necessaryProviding an integer implementation requires sub-classing QuantizedOp to create a new operation. This sub-class must override q_impl in order to provide an integer implementation. QuantizedGemm is an example of such a case where quantized matrix multiplication requires proper handling of scales and zero points. The q_impl of that class reflects this.In the body of q_impl, you can use the _prepare_inputs_with_constants function in order to obtain quantized integer values:
def q_impl(
self,
*q_inputs: QuantizedArray,
**attrs,
) -> QuantizedArray:
# FHE Op-graph design | Concrete ML
prepared_inputs = self._prepare_inputs_with_constants(
*q_inputs, calibrate=False, quantize_actual_values=True
)Here, prepared_inputs will contain one or more QuantizedArray, of which the qvalues are the quantized integers.Once the required integer processing code is implemented, the output of the q_impl function must be implemented as a single QuantizedArray. Most commonly, this is built using the de-quantized results of the processing done in q_impl. sum_result.astype(numpy.float32) - q_input.quantizer.zero_point
) * q_input.quantizer.scale
return QuantizedArray(
self.n_bits,
result,
value_is_float=True,
options=self.input_quant_opts,
stats=self.output_quant_stats,
params=self.output_quant_params,
)Case 3: Both a floating point and an integer implementation are necessaryIn this case, in q_impl you can check whether the current operation can be fused by calling self.can_fuse(). You can then have both a floating-point and an integer implementation. The traced execution path will depend on can_fuse():def q_impl(
self,
*q_inputs: QuantizedArray,
**attrs,
) -> QuantizedArray:
execute_in_float = len(self.constant_inputs) > 0 or self.can_fuse()

Importing ONNX | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageProject architectureImporting ONNXInternally, Concrete ML uses ONNX operators as intermediate representation (or IR) for manipulating machine learning models produced through export for PyTorch, Hummingbird, and skorch.As ONNX is becoming the standard exchange format for neural networks, this allows Concrete ML to be flexible while also making model representation manipulation easy. In addition, it allows for straight-forward mapping to NumPy operators, supported by Concrete to use Concrete stack's FHE-conversion capabilities.Torch to NumPy conversion using ONNXThe diagram below gives an overview of the steps involved in the conversion of an ONNX graph to an FHE-compatible format (i.e., a format that can be compiled to FHE through Concrete).All Concrete ML built-in models follow the same pattern for FHE conversion:The models are trained with sklearn or PyTorch.All models have a PyTorch implementation for inference. This implementation is provided either by a third-party tool such as Hummingbird or implemented directly in Concrete ML.The PyTorch model is exported to ONNX. For more information on the use of ONNX in Concrete ML, see here.The Concrete ML ONNX parser checks that all the operations in the ONNX graph are supported and assigns reference NumPy operations to them. This step produces a NumpyModule.Quantization is performed on the NumpyModule, producing a QuantizedModule. Two steps are performed: calibration and assignment of equivalent QuantizedOp objects to each ONNX operation. The QuantizedModule class is the quantized counterpart of the NumpyModule.Once the QuantizedModule is built, Concrete is used to trace the ._forward() function of the QuantizedModule.Moreover, by passing a user provided nn.Module to step 2 of the above process, Concrete ML supports custom user models. See the associated FHE-friendly model documentation for instructions about working with such models.Torch compilation flow with ONNXOnce an ONNX model is imported, it is converted to a NumpyModule, then to a QuantizedModule and, finally, to an FHE circuit. However, as the diagram shows, it is perfectly possible to stop at the NumpyModule level if you just want to run the PyTorch model as NumPy code without doing quantization.Note that the NumpyModule interpreter currently supports the following ONNX operators.Inspecting the ONNX modelsIn order to better understand how Concrete ML works under the hood, it is possible to access each model in their ONNX format and then either print it or visualize it by importing the associated file in Netron.

Quantized modulesMachine learning models are implemented with a diverse set of operations, such as convolution, linear transformations, activation functions, and element-wise operations. When working with quantized values, these operations cannot be carried out in an equivalent way to floating point values. With quantization, it is necessary to re-scale the input and output values of each operation to fit in the quantization domain.In Concrete ML, the quantized equivalent of a scikit-learn model or a PyTorch nn.Module is the QuantizedModule. Note that only inference is implemented in the QuantizedModule, and it is built through a conversion of the inference function of the corresponding scikit-learn or PyTorch module.Built-in neural networks expose the quantized_module member, while a QuantizedModule is also the result of the compilation of custom models through compile_torch_model and compile_brevitas_qat_model.The quantized versions of floating point model operations are stored in the QuantizedModule. The ONNX_OPS_TO_QUANTIZED_IMPL dictionary maps ONNX floating point operators (e.g., Gemm) to their quantized equivalent (e.g., QuantizedGemm). For more information on implementing these operations, please see the FHE-compatible op-graph section.The computation graph is taken from the corresponding floating point ONNX graph exported from scikit-learn using HummingBird, or from the ONNX graph exported by PyTorch. Calibration is used to obtain quantized parameters for the operations in the QuantizedModule. Parameters are also determined for the quantization of inputs during model deployment.Calibration is the process of determining the typical distributions of values encountered for the intermediate values of a model during inference.To perform calibration, an interpreter goes through the ONNX graph in topological order and stores the intermediate results as it goes. The statistics of these values determine quantization parameters.That QuantizedModule generates the Concrete function that is compiled to FHE. The compilation will succeed if the intermediate values conform to the 16-bits precision limit of the Concrete stack. See the compilation section for details.ResourcesLei Mao's blog on quantization: Quantization for Neural NetworksGoogle paper on neural network quantization and integer-only inference: Quantization and Training of Neural Networks for Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only InferencePreviousImporting ONNXNextFHE Op-graph designLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Debugging models | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageDebugging modelsThis section provides a set of tools and guidelines to help users debug errors and build optimized models that are compatible with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).SimulationThe simulation functionality of Concrete ML provides a way to evaluate, using clear data, the results that ML models produce on encrypted data. The simulation includes any probabilistic behavior FHE may induce. The simulation is implemented with Concrete's simulation.The simulation mode can be useful when developing and iterating on an ML model implementation. As FHE non-linear models work with integers up to 16 bits, with a trade-off between the number of bits and the FHE execution speed, the simulation can help to find the optimal model design.Simulation is much faster than FHE execution. This allows for faster debugging and model optimization. For example, this was used for the red/blue contours in the Classifier Comparison notebook, as computing in FHE for the whole grid and all the classifiers would take significant time.The following example shows how to use the simulation mode in Concrete ML. sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml, make_circles
from concrete.ml.sklearn import RandomForestClassifier
n_bits = 2
X, y = make_circles(n_samples=1000, noise=0.1, factor=0.6, random_state=0)
concrete_clf = RandomForestClassifier(
n_bits=n_bits, n_estimators=10, max_depth=5
)
concrete_clf.fit(X, y)
concrete_clf.compile(X)
# Debugging models | Concrete ML
y_preds_clear = concrete_clf.predict(X, fhe="simulate")Caching keys during debuggingIt is possible to avoid re-generating the keys of the models you are debugging. This feature is unsafe and should not be used in production. Here is an example that shows how to enable key-caching:from concrete.ml.sklearn import RandomForestClassifier
from concrete.fhe import Configuration
debug_config = Configuration(
enable_unsafe_features=True,
use_insecure_key_cache=True,
insecure_key_cache_location="~/.cml_keycache",
)
n_bits = 2
X, y = make_circles(n_samples=1000, noise=0.1, factor=0.6, random_state=0)
concrete_clf = RandomForestClassifier(
n_bits=n_bits, n_estimators=10, max_depth=5
)
concrete_clf.fit(X, y)
concrete_clf.compile(X, debug_config)Common compilation errors1. TLU input maximum bit-width is exceededError message: this [N]-bit value is used as an input to a table lookupCause: This error can occur when rounding_threshold_bits is not used and accumulated intermediate values in the computation exceed 16 bits. To pinpoint the model layer that causes the error, Concrete ML provides the bitwidth_and_range_report helper function. To use this function, the model must be compiled first so that it can be simulated.Possible solutions:Reduce quantization n_bits. However, this may reduce accuracy. When quantization n_bits must be below 6, it is best to use Quantization Aware Training.Use rounding_threshold_bits. This feature is described here. It is recommended to use the fhe.Exactness.APPROXIMATE setting, and set the rounding bits to 1 or 2 bits higher than the quantization n_bitsUse pruning2. No crypto-parameters can be foundError message: RuntimeError: NoParametersFoundCause: This error occurs when cryptosystem parameters can not be found for the model bit-width, rounding mode and requested p_error, when using rounding_threshold_bits in the compile_torch_model function. With rounding_threshold_bits set, the 16-bit accumulator limit is relaxed, so the this [N]-bit value is used as an input to a table lookup does not occur. However, cryptosystem-parameters may still not exist for the model to be compiled.Possible solutions: The solutions in this case are similar to the ones for the previous error: reducing bit-width, or reducing the rounding_threshold_bits, or using the fhe.Exactness.APPROXIMATE rounding method can help. Additionally adjusting the tolerance for one-off errors using the p_error parameter can help, as explained in this section.3. Quantization import failedError message: Error occurred during quantization aware training (QAT) import [...] Are you missing a QuantIdentity layer in your Brevitas model?.Cause: This error occurs when the model imported as a quantized-aware training model lacks quantization operators. See this guide on how to use Brevitas layers. This error message indicates that some layers do not take inputs quantized through QuantIdentity layers.A common example is related to the concatenation operator. Suppose two tensors x and y are produced by two layers and need to be concatenated:y = self.dense2(y)
z = torch.cat([x, y])In the example above, the x and y layers need quantization before being concatenated.Possible solutions:If the error occurs for the first layer of the model: Add a QuantIdentity layer in your model and apply it on the input of the forward function, before the first layer is computed.If the error occurs for a concatenation or addition layer: Add a new QuantIdentity layer in your model. Suppose it is called quant_concat. In the forward function, before concatenation of x and y, apply it to both tensors that are concatenated. The usage of a common Quantidentity layer to quantize both tensors that are concatenated ensures that they have the same scale:PBS complexity and optimizationIn FHE, univariate functions are encoded as Table Lookups, which are then implemented using Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS). PBS is a powerful technique but requires significantly more computing resources compared to simpler encrypted operations such as matrix multiplications, convolution, or additions.Furthermore, the cost of PBS depends on the bit-width of the compiled circuit. Every additional bit in the maximum bit-width significantly increase the complexity of the PBS. Therefore, it is important to determine the bit-width of the circuit and the amount of PBS it performs in order to optimize the performance.To inspect the MLIR code produced by the compiler, use the following command:Example output:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In the MLIR code, there are several calls to FHELinalg.apply_mapped_lookup_table and FHELinalg.apply_lookup_table.

Thus, the PBS is applied 10 times, corresponding to the size of every encrypted tensor, which is 1x5 multiplied by 2.To retrieve the bit-width of the circuit, use this command:Reducing the number of bits and the number of PBS applications can significantly decrease the computation time of the compiled circuit.PreviousStep-by-step guideNextOptimizing inferenceLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Step-by-step guide | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageStep-by-step guideThis guide demonstrates how to convert a PyTorch neural network into a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)-friendly, quantized version. It focuses on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) using a simple network on a synthetic data-set. This guide is based on a notebook tutorial, from which some code blocks are documented.QuantizationIn general, quantization can be carried out in two different ways:During the training phase with Quantization Aware Training (QAT)After the training phase with Post Training Quantization (PTQ).For FHE-friendly neural networks, QAT is the best method to achieve optimal accuracy under FHE constraints. This technique reduces weights and activations to very low bit-widths (for example, 2-3 bits). When combined with pruning, QAT helps keep low accumulator bit-widths.Concrete ML uses the third-party library Brevitas to perform QAT for PyTorch neural networks, but options exist for other frameworks such as Keras/Tensorflow. Concrete ML provides several demos and tutorials that use Brevitas , including the CIFAR classification tutorial. For a more formal description of the usage of Brevitas to build FHE-compatible neural networks, please see the Brevitas usage reference.For a formal explanation of the mechanisms that enable FHE-compatible neural networks, please see the the following paper.Deep Neural Networks for Encrypted Inference with TFHE, 7th International Symposium, CSCML 2023Baseline PyTorch modelIn PyTorch, using standard layers, a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) would look like this: torch
from torch import nn
IN_FEAT = 2
OUT_FEAT = 2
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
"""Simple MLP with PyTorch"""
def __init__(self, n_hidden = 30):
super().__init__()
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_features=IN_FEAT, out_features=n_hidden)
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(in_features=n_hidden, out_features=n_hidden)
self.fc3 = nn.Linear(in_features=n_hidden, out_features=OUT_FEAT)
def forward(self, x):
"""Forward pass."""
x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
x = self.fc3(x)
return xSimilarly to the one above, the notebook tutorial shows how to train a FCNN on a synthetic 2D data-set with a checkerboard grid pattern of 100 x 100 points. The data is split into 9500 training and 500 test samples.Once trained, you can import this PyTorch network using the compile_torch_model function, which uses simple PTQ.The network was trained using different numbers of neurons in the hidden layers, and quantized using 3-bits weights and activations. The mean accumulator size, shown below, is measured as the mean over 10 runs of the experiment. An accumulator size of 6.6 means that 4 times out of 10, the accumulator was 6 bits, while 6 times it was 7 bits.fp32 accuracy68.70%83.32%88.06%3-bit accuracy56.44%55.54%56.50%mean accumulator size6.66.97.4This shows that the fp32 accuracy and accumulator size increases with the number of hidden neurons, while the 3-bits accuracy remains low regardless of the number of neurons. Although all configurations tested were FHE-compatible (accumulator < 16 bits), it is often preferable to have a lower accumulator size to speed up inference time.Accumulator size is determined by Concrete as the maximum bit-width encountered anywhere in the encrypted circuit.Quantization Aware Training (QAT)Using QAT with Brevitas is the best way to guarantee a good accuracy for Concrete ML compatible neural networks.Brevitas provides quantized versions of almost all PyTorch layers. For example, Linear layer becomes QuantLinear, and ReLU layer becomes QuantReLU. Brevitas also offers additional quantization parameters, such as:bit_width: precision quantization bits for activationsact_quant: quantization protocol for the activationsweight_bit_width: precision quantization bits for weightsweight_quant: quantization protocol for the weightsTo use FHE, the network must be quantized from end to end. With the Brevitas QuantIdentity layer, you can quantize the input by placing it at the network's entry point. Moreover, you can combine PyTorch and Brevitas layers, as long as a QuantIdentity layer follows the PyTorch layer. The following table lists the replacements needed to convert a PyTorch neural network for Concrete ML compatibility.torch.nn.Linearbrevitas.quant.QuantLineartorch.nn.Conv2dbrevitas.quant.Conv2dtorch.nn.AvgPool2dtorch.nn.AvgPool2d + brevitas.quant.QuantIdentitytorch.nn.ReLUbrevitas.quant.QuantReLUSome PyTorch operators (from the PyTorch functional API), require a brevitas.quant.QuantIdentity to be applied on their inputs.torch.transposetorch.add (between two activation tensors)torch.reshapetorch.flattenThe QAT import tool in Concrete ML is a work in progress. While it has been tested with some networks built with Brevitas, it is possible to use other tools to obtain QAT networks.With Brevitas, the network above becomes:from brevitas.core.quant import QuantType
from brevitas.quant import Int8ActPerTensorFloat, Int8WeightPerTensorFloat
N_BITS = 3
IN_FEAT = 2
OUT_FEAT = 2

super().__init__()
self.quant_inp = qnn.QuantIdentity(**qidentity_args)
self.fc1 = qnn.QuantLinear(IN_FEAT, n_hidden, **qlinear_args)
self.relu1 = qnn.QuantReLU(bit_width=qidentity_args["bit_width"])
self.fc2 = qnn.QuantLinear(n_hidden, n_hidden, **qlinear_args)
self.relu2 = qnn.QuantReLU(bit_width=qidentity_args["bit_width"])
self.fc3 = qnn.QuantLinear(n_hidden, OUT_FEAT, **qlinear_args)
for m in self.modules():
if isinstance(m, qnn.QuantLinear):
torch.nn.init.uniform_(m.weight.data, -1, 1)
def forward(self, x):
x = self.quant_inp(x)
x = self.relu1(self.fc1(x))
x = self.relu2(self.fc2(x))
x = self.fc3(x)
return x In the network above, biases are used for linear layers but are not quantized ("bias": True, "bias_quant": None). The addition of the bias is a univariate operation and is fused into the activation function.Training this network with pruning (see below) using 30 out of 100 total non-zero neurons gives good accuracy while keeping the accumulator size low.3-bit accuracy brevitas95.4%3-bit accuracy in Concrete ML95.4%Accumulator size7The PyTorch QAT training loop is the same as the standard floating point training loop, but hyper-parameters such as learning rate might need to be adjusted.QAT is somewhat slower than normal training. QAT introduces quantization during both the forward and backward passes. The quantization process is inefficient on GPUs due to its low computational intensity is low relative to data transfer time.Pruning using TorchConsidering that FHE only works with limited integer precision, there is a risk of overflowing in the accumulator, which will make Concrete ML raise an error.To understand how to overcome this limitation, consider a scenario where 2 bits are used for weights and layer inputs/outputs. The Linear layer computes a dot product between weights and inputs y=∑iwixiy = \sum_i w_i x_iy=∑i​wi​xi​. With 2 bits, no overflow can occur during the computation of the Linear layer as long the number of neurons does not exceed 14, as in the sum of 14 products of 2-bits numbers does not exceed 7 bits.By default, Concrete ML uses symmetric quantization for model weights, with values in the interval [−2nbits−1,2nbits−1−1]\left[-2^{n_{bits}-1}, 2^{n_{bits}-1}-1\right][−2nbits​−1,2nbits​−1−1]. For example, for nbits=2n_{bits}=2nbits​=2 the possible values are [−2,−1,0,1][-2, -1, 0, 1][−2,−1,0,1]; for nbits=3n_{bits}=3nbits​=3, the values can be [−4,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3][-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3][−4,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3].In a typical setting, the weights will not all have the maximum or minimum values (such as −2nbits−1-2^{n_{bits}-1}−2nbits​−1). Weights typically have a normal distribution around 0, which is one of the motivating factors for their symmetric quantization. A symmetric distribution and many zero-valued weights are desirable because opposite sign weights can cancel each other out and zero weights do not increase the accumulator size.This fact can be leveraged to train a network with more neurons, while not overflowing the accumulator, using a technique called pruning where the developer can impose a number of zero-valued weights. Torch provides support for pruning out of the box.The following code shows how to use pruning in the previous example:
class PrunedQuantNet(SimpleNet):
"""Simple MLP with PyTorch"""
pruned_layers = set()
def prune(self, max_non_zero):
# Step-by-step guide | Concrete ML
for name, layer in self.named_modules():
if isinstance(layer, nn.Linear):
print(name, layer)
num_zero_weights = (layer.weight.shape[1] - max_non_zero) * layer.weight.shape[0]
if num_zero_weights <= 0:
continue
print(f"Pruning layer {name} factor {num_zero_weights}")
prune.l1_unstructured(layer, "weight", amount=num_zero_weights)
self.pruned_layers.add(name)
def unprune(self):
for name, layer in self.named_modules():
if name in self.pruned_layers:
prune.remove(layer, "weight")
self.pruned_layers.remove(name)Results with PrunedQuantNet, a pruned version of the QuantSimpleNet with 100 neurons on the hidden layers, are given below, showing a mean accumulator size measured over 10 runs of the experiment:3-bit accuracy82.50%88.06%Mean accumulator size6.66.8This shows that the fp32 accuracy has been improved while maintaining constant mean accumulator size.When pruning a larger neural network during training, it is easier to obtain a low bit-width accumulator while maintaining better final accuracy. Thus, pruning is more robust than training a similar, smaller network.PreviousUsing ONNXNextDebugging modelsLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Using ONNX | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageUsing ONNXThis document explains how to compile ONNX models in Concrete ML. This is particularly useful for importing models trained with Keras.You can compile ONNX models by directly importing models that are already quantized with Quantization Aware Training (QAT) or by performing Post Training Quantization (PTQ) with Concrete ML.Simple exampleThe following example shows how to compile an ONNX model using PTQ. The model was initially trained using Keras before being exported to ONNX. The training code is not shown here.This example uses PTQ, meaning that the quantization is not performed during training. This model does not have the optimal performance in FHE.To improve performance in FHE, you should add QAT. Additionally, you can also import QAT ONNX models as shown below. numpy

# Optimizing inference | Concrete ML

Optimizing inference | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOptimizing inferenceThis document introduces several approaches to reduce the overall latency of a neural network.IntroductionNeural networks are challenging for encrypted inference. Each neuron in a network has to apply an activation function that requires a Programmable Bootstrapping(PBS) operation. The latency of a single PBS depends on the bit-width of its input.Circuit bit-width optimizationQuantization Aware Training and pruning introduce specific hyper-parameters that influence the accumulator sizes. You can chose quantization and pruning configurations to reduce the accumulator size. To obtain a trade-off between latency and accuracy, you can manually set these hyper-parameters as described in the deep learning design guide.Structured pruningWhile using unstructured pruning ensures the accumulator bit-width stays low, structured pruning can eliminate entire neurons from the network as many neural networks are over-parametrized for easier training. You can apply structured pruning to a trained network as a fine-tuning step. This example demonstrates how to apply structured pruning to built-in neural networks using the prune helper function. To apply structured pruning to custom models, it is recommended to use the torch-pruning package.Rounded activations and quantizersReducing the bit-width of inputs to the Table Lookup (TLU) operations significantly improves latency. Post-training, you can leverage properties of the fused activation and quantization functions in the TLUs to further reduce the accumulator size. This is achieved through the rounded PBS feature as described in the rounded activations and quantizers reference. Adjusting the rounding amount relative to the initial accumulator size can improve latency while maintaining accuracy.TLU error tolerance adjustmentFinally, the TFHE scheme introduces a TLU error tolerance parameter that has an impact on crypto-system parameters that influence latency. A higher tolerance of TLU off-by-one errors results in faster computations but may reduce accuracy. You can think of the error of obtaining T[x]T[x]T[x] as a Gaussian distribution centered on xxx: TLU[x]TLU[x]TLU[x] is obtained with probability of 1 - p_error, while T[x−1]T[x-1]T[x−1], T[x+1]T[x+1]T[x+1] are obtained with much lower probability, etc. In Deep NNs, these type of errors can be tolerated up to some point. See the p_error documentation for details and more specifically the API for finding the best p_error.PreviousDebugging modelsNextPrediction with FHELast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Production deployment | Concrete ML

Production deployment | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageProduction deploymentThis document explains the deployment workflow and the model serving pattern for deploying Fully Homomorphic Encryption machine learning models in a client/server setting using Concrete ML.DeploymentThe steps to prepare a model for encrypted inference in a client/server setting is illustrated as follows:Model training and compilationThe training of the model and its compilation to FHE are performed on a development machine.Three different files are created when saving the model:client.zip contains the following files:client.specs.json lists the secure cryptographic parameters needed for the client to generate private and evaluation keys.serialized_processing.json describes the pre-processing and post-processing required by the machine learning model, such as quantization parameters to quantize the input and de-quantize the output.server.zip contains the compiled model. This file is sufficient to run the model on a server. The compiled model is machine-architecture specific, for example, a model compiled on x86 cannot run on ARM.Model deploymentThe compiled model (server.zip) is deployed to a server. The cryptographic parameters (client.zip) are shared with the clients. In some settings, such as a phone application, the client.zip can be directly deployed on the client device and the server does not need to host it.Important: In a client-server production using FHE, the server's output format depends on the model type:For regressors, the output matches the predict() method from scikit-learn, providing direct predictions.For classifiers, the output uses the predict_proba() method format, offering probability scores for each class, which allows clients to determine class membership by applying a threshold (commonly 0.5).Using the API ClassesThe FHEModelDev, FHEModelClient, and FHEModelServer classes in the concrete.ml.deployment module simplifies the deployment and interaction between the client and server:FHEModelDev:This class handles the serialization of the underlying FHE circuit as well as the crypto-parameters used for generating the keys.Use the save method of this class during the development phase to prepare and save the model artifacts (client.zip and server.zip). With save method, you can deploy a trained model or a training FHE program.FHEModelClient is used on the client side for the following actions:Generate and serialize the cryptographic keys.Encrypt the data before sending it to the server.Decrypt the results received from the server.Load quantization parameters and pre/post-processing from serialized_processing.json.FHEModelServer is used on the server side for the following actions:Load the FHE circuit from server.zip .Execute the model on encrypted data received from the client.Example Usagefrom concrete.ml.deployment import FHEModelDev, FHEModelClient, FHEModelServer

result = client.deserialize_decrypt_dequantize(encrypted_result[0])In the example above, a second evaluation key is obtained in the tfhers_evaluation_keys variable. This key can be loaded by TFHE-rs Rust programs to perform further computation on the model output ciphertexts.ServingThe client-side deployment of a secured inference machine learning model is illustrated as follows:The workflow contains the following steps:Key generation: The client obtains the cryptographic parameters stored in client.zip and generates a private encryption/decryption key as well as a set of public evaluation keys.Sending public keys: The public evaluation keys are sent to the server, while the secret key remains on the client.Data encryption: The private data is encrypted by the client as described in the serialized_processing.json file in client.zip.Data transmission: The encrypted data is sent to the server.Encrypted inference: Server-side, the FHE model inference is run on encrypted inputs using the public evaluation keys.Data transmission: The encrypted result is returned by the server to the client.Data decryption: The client decrypts it using its private key.Post-processing: The client performs any necessary post-processing of the decrypted result as specified in serialized_processing.json (part of client.zip).The server-side implementation of a Concrete ML model is illustrated as follows:The workflow contains the following steps:Storing the public key: The public evaluation keys sent by clients are stored.Model evaluation: The public evaluation keys are retrieved for the client that is querying the service and used to evaluate the machine learning model stored in server.zip.Sending back the result: The server sends the encrypted result of the computation back to the client.Example notebookFor a complete example, see the client-server notebook or the use-case examples.PreviousPrediction with FHENextHybrid modelsLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Hybrid models | Concrete ML

*Source: concrete-ml/guides/hybrid-models.html*

Hybrid models | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHybrid modelsThis document explains how to use Concrete ML API to deploy hybrid models in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).IntroductionFHE allows cloud applications to process private user data securely, minimizing the risk of data leaks. Deploying machine learning (ML) models in the cloud offers several advantages:Simplifies model updates.Scales to large user bases by leveraging substantial compute power.Protects model's Intellectual Property (IP) by keeping the model on a trusted server rather than on client devices.However, not all applications can be easily converted to FHE computation. The high computation cost of FHE might exceed latency requirements for full conversion.Hybrid models provide a balance between on-device deployment and cloud-based deployment. This approach involves:Executing parts of the model on the client side.Securely processing other parts with FHE on the server side.Concrete ML supports hybrid deployment for various neural network models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Large Language Models(LLM).To protect model IP, carefully choose the model parts to execute in the cloud. Some black-box model stealing attacks use knowledge distillation or differential methods. Generally, the difficulty of stealing a machine learning model increases with the model's size, number of parameters, and depth.The hybrid model deployment API simplifies integrating the standard deployment procedure into neural network style models that are compiled with compile_brevitas_qat_model or compile_torch_model.CompilationTo use hybrid model deployment, the first step is to define which part of the PyTorch neural network model must be executed in FHE. Ensure the model part is a nn.Module and is identified by its key in the original model's .named_modules().Here is an example:import os
import torch
from pathlib import Path
from torch import nn
from concrete.ml.torch.hybrid_model import HybridFHEModel, tuple_to_underscore_str
from concrete.ml.deployment import FHEModelServer
class FCSmall(nn.Module):
"""Torch model for the tests."""
def __init__(self, dim):
super().__init__()
self.seq = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(dim, dim), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(dim, dim))
def forward(self, x):
return self.seq(x)
dim = 10
model = FCSmall(dim)
model_name = "FCSmall"
submodule_name = "seq.0"
inputs = torch.Tensor(np.random.uniform(size=(10, dim)))
# Hybrid models | Concrete ML
print([k for (k, _) in model.named_modules()])
# Hybrid models | Concrete ML
hybrid_model = HybridFHEModel(model, [submodule_name])
hybrid_model.compile_model(
inputs,
n_bits=8,
)
models_dir = Path(os.path.abspath('')) / "compiled_models"
models_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
model_dir = models_dir / model_name
Server Side DeploymentThe save_and_clear_private_info functions as follows:Serializes the FHE circuits for the model parts chosen to be server-side.Saves the client-side model, removing the weights of the layers transferred to the server.Saves all necessary information required to serve these sub-models with FHE using the FHEModelDev class.To create a server application that serves these sub-models, use the FHEModelServer class:MODULES = { model_name: { submodule_name: {"path": model_dir / submodule_name / input_shape_subdir }}}
server = FHEModelServer(str(MODULES[model_name][submodule_name]["path"]))For more information about serving FHE models, see the client/server section.Client SideYou can develop a client application that deploys a model with hybrid deployment in a very similar manner to on-premise deployment: Use PyTorch to load the model normally, but specify the remote endpoint and the part of the model to be executed remotely.hybrid_model = HybridFHEModel(
model, # PyTorch or Brevitas model
submodule_name,
server_remote_address="http://0.0.0.0:8000",
model_name=f"{model_name}",
verbose=False,
)Next, obtain the parameters necessary to encrypt and quantize data, as detailed in the client/server documentation.hybrid_model.init_client(path_to_clients=path_to_clients)When the client application is ready to make inference requests to the server, set the operation mode of the HybridFHEModel instance to HybridFHEMode.REMOTE: module.fhe_local_mode = HybridFHEMode.REMOTE For inference with the HybridFHEModel instance, hybrid_model, call the regular forward method as if the model was fully deployed locally::When calling HybridFHEModel, it handles all the necessary intermediate steps for each model part deployed remotely, including:Quantizing the data.Encrypting the data.Making the request to the server using requests Python module.Decrypting and de-quantizing the result.PreviousProduction deploymentNextSerializationLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Serialization | Concrete ML

*Source: concrete-ml/guides/serialization.html*

Serialization | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSerializationThis document explains how to serialize build-in models in Concrete ML.IntroductionSerialization allows you to dump a fitted and compiled model into a JSON string or file. You can then load the estimator back using the JSON object.Saving ModelsAll built-in models provide the following methods:dumps: Dumps the model as a string.dump: Dumps the model into a file.For example, a logistic regression model can be dumped in a string as follows: sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from concrete.ml.sklearn import LogisticRegression
# Serialization | Concrete ML
X, y = make_classification()
# Serialization | Concrete ML
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4)
# Serialization | Concrete ML
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
model.compile(X_train)
# Serialization | Concrete ML
y_pred_fhe = model.predict(X_test, fhe="execute")
# Serialization | Concrete ML
dumped_model_str = model.dumps()
Similarly, it can be dumped into a file:
dumped_model_path = Path("logistic_regression_model.json")
# Serialization | Concrete ML
with dumped_model_path.open("w") as f:
# Serialization | Concrete ML
model.dump(f)Alternatively, Concrete ML provides two equivalent global functions:
# Serialization | Concrete ML
dumped_model_str = dumps(model)
# Serialization | Concrete ML
with dumped_model_path.open("w") as f:
# Serialization | Concrete ML
dump(model, f)Some parameters used for instantiating Quantized Neural Network models are not supported for serialization. In particular, you cannot serialize a model that was instantiated using callable objects for the train_split and predict_nonlinearity parameters or with callbacks being enabled.Loading ModelsYou can load a built-in model using the following functions:loads: Loads the model from a string.load: Loads the model from a file.A loaded model must be compiled once again to execute the inference in
FHE or with simulation because the underlying FHE circuit is currently not serialized.
This recompilation is not required when FHE mode is disabled.The same logistic regression model can be loaded as follows:from concrete.ml.common.serialization.loaders import load, loads
# Serialization | Concrete ML
loaded_model = loads(dumped_model_str)
# Serialization | Concrete ML
with dumped_model_path.open("r") as f:
# Serialization | Concrete ML
loaded_model = load(f)
# Serialization | Concrete ML
loaded_model.compile(X_train)
# Serialization | Concrete ML

# GPU acceleration | Concrete ML

GPU acceleration | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationThis document provides a complete instruction on using GPU acceleration with Concrete ML.Concrete ML support compiling both built-in and custom models using a CUDA-accelerated backend. However, once
a model is compiled for CUDA, executing it on a non-CUDA-enabled machine will raise an error.SupportGPU support✅✅✅❌When compiling a model for GPU, the model is assigned GPU-specific crypto-system parameters. These parameters are more constrained than the CPU-specific ones.
As a result, the Concrete compiler may have difficulty finding suitable GPU-compatible crypto-parameters for some models, leading to a NoParametersFound error.PerformanceOn high-end GPUs like V100, A100, or H100, the performance gains range from 1x to 10x compared to a desktop CPU.When compared to a high-end server CPUs(64-core or 96-core), the speed-up is typically around 1x to 3x.On consumer grade GPUs such as GTX40xx or GTX30xx, there may be
little speedup or even a slowdown compared to execution
on a desktop CPU.PrerequisitesBuilt-in models and deep NNsThis section pertains to models that are compiled using the sklearn-style built-in model classes or that are compiled using compile_torch_model or compile_brevitas_qat_model.To use the CUDA-enabled backend, install the GPU-enabled Concrete compiler:If you already have an existing version of concrete-python installed, it will not be re-installed automatically. In that case, manually uninstall the current version and then install the GPU-enabled version:pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.zama.ai/gpu concrete-pythonTo switch back to the CPU-only version of the compiler, change the index-url to the CPU-only repository or remove the index-url parameter:pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.zama.ai/cpu concrete-pythonChecking GPU can be enabledTo check if the CUDA acceleration is available, use the following helper functions from concrete-python:print("GPU enabled: ", concrete.compiler.check_gpu_enabled())
print("GPU available: ", concrete.compiler.check_gpu_available())UsageTo compile a model for CUDA, simply supply the device='cuda' argument to its compilation function:For built-in models, use .compile function.For custom models, use eithercompile_torch_model or compile_brevitas_qat_model.LLMsThis section pertains to models that are compiled with HybridFHEModel.The models compiled as described in the LLM section will
use GPU acceleration if a GPU is available on the machine where the models
are executed. No specific compilation configuration is required to enable GPU
execution for these models.PreviousSerializationNextSee all tutorialsLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

For examples showing how to train high-accuracy models on more complex data-sets, see the Demos and Tutorials section.FHE constraints considerationsThe examples listed here make use of simulation to perform evaluation over large test sets. Since FHE execution can be slow, only a few FHE executions can be performed. The correctness guarantees of Concrete ML ensure that accuracy measured with simulation is the same as that which will be obtained during FHE execution.Some examples constrain accumulators to 7-8 bits, which can be sufficient for simple data-sets.

For more examples showing how to train high-accuracy models on more complex data-sets, see the Demos and Tutorials section.FHE constraintsIn Concrete ML, built-in linear models are exact equivalents to their scikit-learn counterparts. As they do not apply any non-linearity during inference, these models are very fast (~1ms FHE inference time) and can use high-precision integers (between 20-25 bits).Tree-based models apply non-linear functions that enable comparisons of inputs and trained thresholds. Thus, they are limited with respect to the number of bits used to represent the inputs. But as these examples show, in practice 5-6 bits are sufficient to exactly reproduce the behavior of their scikit-learn counterpart models.In the examples below, built-in neural networks can be configured to work with user-specified accumulator sizes, which allow the user to adjust the speed/accuracy trade-off.It is recommended to use simulation to configure the speed/accuracy trade-off for tree-based models and neural networks, using grid-search or your own heuristics.List of examples1.

# Encrypted fine-tuning | Concrete ML

*Source: concrete-ml/llms/lora_training.html*

Encrypted fine-tuning | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageEncrypted fine-tuningThis document explains how to fine-tune neural-network models and large language-models (LLMs) on private data.Small models can be fine-tuned using a single-client/single-server setup. For larger models (such as GPT-2 and above), consider using distributed computation across multiple worker nodes to perform training on encrypted data for optimal latency.OverviewRefer to this notebook to see the tutorial about applying FHE LoRA fine-tuning to a small neural network.Concrete ML supports LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach, in the hybrid model paradigm. LoRA adds adapter layers, which contain a small number of trainable parameters, to the linear layers of a base model.In this setup, Concrete ML outsources the computationally intensive parts of forward and backward passes for large models to one or more remote servers. The training client machine only handles the LoRA-adapter forward/backward passes, loss computation, and adapter weight updates. Since the LoRA adapters are small, this additional computation on the client side is minimal. For large LLMs, over 99% of the model's weights can remain outsourced.The main benefit of hybrid-model LoRA training is outsourcing the computation of linear layers, which are typically large in LLMs. These layers require substantial hardware for inference and gradient computation. By securely outsourcing this work, Concrete ML removes the memory bottleneck that previously limited such operations.UsageConcrete ML integrates with the peft package to add LoRA adapters to a model's linear layers. Below are the steps to convert a model into a hybrid FHE LoRA training setup.1. Apply the peft LoRA layersThe LoraConfig class from the peft package contains the various LoRA parameters. You can specify which layers have LoRA adapters through the target_modules argument.
For a detailed reference of the various configuration options, refer to theLoraConfig

)2. Convert the LoRA model to use custom Concrete ML layersNext, we need to integrate the LoRA-adapted peft_model into the Concrete ML hybrid FHE training framework. This is done using the LoraTrainer class, which handles the logic of encrypting outsourced computations, running the forward and backward passes, and updating the LoRA adapter weights.You can configure:The loss function.The optimizer and its parameters.Gradient accumulation steps (if needed).def simple_loss(outputs, targets):
return F.cross_entropy(outputs, targets)
# Encrypted fine-tuning | Concrete ML

# Encrypted fine-tuning | Concrete ML
lora_trainer = LoraTrainer(
peft_model,
optimizer=optimizer,
loss_fn=simple_loss,
)3. Compile a hybrid FHE model for the LoRA adapted PyTorch modelBefore training in FHE, we need to compile the model. Compilation calibrates and converts the outsourced linear layers to their FHE equivalents. The compile method uses representative data for this step.inputset = (
torch.Tensor(X_task2[:16]),
torch.LongTensor(y_task2[:16]),
)
# Encrypted fine-tuning | Concrete ML
lora_trainer.compile(inputset, n_bits=8)At this point, the trainer has a hybrid FHE model ready for encrypted execution of the outsourced layers. The LoRA layers remain on the client side in the clear.4. Train the model on private dataYou can now train the hybrid FHE model with your private data. The train method will run forward and backward passes, updating only the LoRA adapter weights locally while securely outsourcing the main layers’ computations.lora_trainer.train(train_loader_task2, fhe="execute")Additional optionsInferenceOnce fine-tuned, the LoRA hybrid FHE model can perform inference only, through thepeft_model attribute of the hybrid FHE model.Toggle LoRA layersTo compare to the original model, you can disable the LoRA weights to use the original model for inference.peft_model(x)

During this process, Concrete ML generates the private encryption keys and the pubic evaluation keys.Communication protocolsThe overall communications protocol to enable cloud deployment of machine learning services can be summarized in the following diagram:The steps detailed above are:Model Deployment: The model developer deploys the compiled machine learning model to the server. This model includes the cryptographic parameters. The server is now ready to provide private inference. Cryptographic parameters and compiled programs for DataFrames are included directly in Concrete ML.Client request: The client requests the cryptographic parameters (client specs). Once the client receives them from the server, the secret and evaluation keys are generated.Key exchanges: The client sends the evaluation key to the server. The server is now ready to accept requests from this client. The client sends their encrypted data. Serialized DataFrames include client evaluation keys.Private inference: The server uses the evaluation key to securely run prediction, training and pre-processing on the user's data and sends back the encrypted result.Decryption: The client now decrypts the result and can send back new requests.For more information on how to implement this basic secure inference protocol, refer to the Production Deployment section and to the client/server example.

To make machine learning models compatible with FHE, Concrete ML implements some techniques with accuracy considerations:Quantization: Concrete ML quantizes inputs, outputs, weights, and activations to meet FHE limitations. See the quantization documentation for details.Accuracy trade-off: Quantization may reduce accuracy, but careful selection of quantization parameters or of the training approach can mitigate this. Concrete ML offers built-in quantized models; users only configure parameters like bit-width. For more details of quantization configurations, see the advanced quantization guide.Additional methods: Dimensionality reduction and pruning are additional ways to make programs compatible for FHE. See Poisson regression example for dimensionality reduction and built-in neural networks for pruning.PreviousInstallationNextInference in the cloudLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Encrypted dataframe | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageEncrypted dataframeThis document introduces how to construct and perform operations on encrypted DataFrames using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).IntroductionEncrypted DataFrames are a storage format for encrypted tabular data. You can exchange encrypted DataFrames with third parties to collaborate without privacy risks. Potential applications include:Encrypt storage of tabular data-setsJoint data analysis efforts between multiple partiesData preparation steps before machine learning tasks, such as inference or trainingSecure outsourcing of data analysis to untrusted third partiesEncryption and decryptionTo encrypt a pandas DataFrame, construct a ClientEngine that manages keys and then call the encrypt_from_pandas function: concrete.ml.pandas import ClientEngine
from io import StringIO
import pandas
data_left = """index,total_bill,tip,sex,smoker
1,12.54,2.5,Male,No

# Encrypted dataframe | Concrete ML
df = pandas.read_csv(StringIO(data_left))
# Encrypted dataframe | Concrete ML
client = ClientEngine(keys_path="my_keys")
# Encrypted dataframe | Concrete ML
df_encrypted = client.encrypt_from_pandas(df)
# Encrypted dataframe | Concrete ML
df_decrypted = client.decrypt_to_pandas(df_encrypted)Supported data types and schema definitionInteger: Integers are supported within a specific range determined by the encryption scheme's quantization parameters. Default range is 1 to 15. 0 being used for the NaN. Values outside this range will cause a ValueError to be raised during the pre-processing stage.Quantized Float: Floating-point numbers are quantized to integers within the supported range. This is achieved by computing a scale and zero point for each column, which are used to map the floating-point numbers to the quantized integer space.String Enum: String columns are mapped to integers starting from 1. This mapping is stored and later used for de-quantization. If the number of unique strings exceeds 15, a ValueError is raised.Using a user-defined schemaBefore encryption, the data is preprocessed. For example string enums first need to be mapped to integers, and floating point values must be quantized. By default, this mapping is done automatically. However, when two different clients encrypt their data separately, the automatic mappings may differ, possibly due to some missing values in one of the client's DataFrame. Thus the column can not be selected when merging encrypted DataFrames.The encrypted DataFrame supports user-defined mappings. These schemas are defined as a dictionary where keys represent column names and values contain meta-data about the column. Supported column meta-data are:string columns: mapping between string values and integers.float columns: the min/max range that the column values lie in. "string_column": {"abc": 1, "bcd": 2 },
"float_column": {"min": 0.1, "max": 0.5 }
}Supported operationsEncrypted DataFrame is designed to support a subset of operations that are available for pandas DataFrames. For now, only the merge operation is supported. More operations will be added in the future releases.Merge operationMerge operation allows you to left or right join two DataFrames.[!NOTE]
The merge operation on Encrypted DataFrames can be securely performed on a third-party server, meaning that the server can execute the merge without ever having access to the unencrypted data. The server only requires the encrypted DataFrames.2,Thur,Lunch,2

df_encrypted_merged = df_encrypted.merge(df_encrypted2, how="left", on="index")SerializationYou can serialize encrypted DataFrame objects to a file format for storage or transfer. When serialized, they contain the encrypted data and public evaluation keys necessary to perform computations.[!NOTE]
Serialized DataFrames do not contain any private encryption keys . The DataFrames can be exchanged with any third-party without any risk.To save or load an encrypted DataFrame from a file, use the following commands:

Currently this means that data-frames are limited to 15 rows.Metadata Security: Column names and the mapping of strings to integers are not encrypted and are sent to the server in clear text.PreviousNearest neighborsNextEncrypted trainingLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

See the ciphertexts format documentation for more details.Example concrete.ml.sklearn import KNeighborsClassifier
concrete_classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_bits=2, n_neighbors=3)Quantization parametersThe KNeighborsClassifier class quantizes the training data-set provided to .fit using the specified number of bits (n_bits). To comply with accumulator size constraints, you must keep this value low. The model's accuracy will depend significantly on a well-chosen n_bits value and the dimensionality of the data.The predict method of the KNeighborsClassifier performs the following steps:Quantize the test vectors on clear dataCompute the top-k class indices of the closest training set vector on encrypted dataVote for the top-k class labels to find the class for each test vector, performed on clear dataInference time considerationsThe FHE inference latency of this model is heavily influenced by the n_bits and the dimensionality of the data. Additionally, the data-set size has a linear impact on the data complexity. The number of nearest neighbors (n_neighbors) also affects performance.The KNN computation executes in FHE in O(Nlog2k)O(Nlog^2k)O(Nlog2k) steps, where NNN is the training data-set size and kkk is n_neighbors. Each step requires several PBS operations, with their runtime affected by the factors listed above. These factors determine the precision needed to represent the distances between test vectors and training data-set vectors. The PBS input precision required by the circuit is related to the precision of the distance values.PreviousNeural networksNextEncrypted dataframeLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Neural networks | Concrete ML

Neural networks | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageNeural networksThis document introduces the simple built-in neural networks models that Concrete ML provides with a scikit-learn interface through the NeuralNetClassifier and NeuralNetRegressor classes.Supported modelsNeuralNetClassifierMLPClassifierNeuralNetRegressorMLPRegressorThe neural network models are implemented with skorch, which provides a scikit-learn-like interface to Torch models (more here).Concrete ML models are multi-layer, fully-connected, networks with customizable activation functions and have a number of neurons in each layer. This approach is similar to what is available in scikit-learn when using the MLPClassifier/MLPRegressor classes. The built-in models train easily with a single call to .fit(), which will automatically quantize weights and activations. These models use Quantization Aware Training, allowing good performance for low precision (down to 2-3 bits) weights and activations.While NeuralNetClassifier and NeuralNetClassifier provide scikit-learn-like models, their architecture is somewhat restricted to make training easy and robust. If you need more advanced models, you can convert custom neural networks as described in the FHE-friendly models documentation.Good quantization parameter values are critical to make models respect FHE constraints. Weights and activations should be quantized to low precision (e.g., 2-4 bits). The sparsity of the network can be tuned as described below to avoid accumulator overflow.Using nn.ReLU as the activation function benefits from an optimization where quantization uses powers-of-two scales. This results in much faster inference times in FHE, thanks to a TFHE primitive that performs fast division by powers of two.Ciphertext format compatibilityThese models only support Concrete ciphertexts. See the ciphertexts format documentation for more details.ExampleTo create an instance of a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), you need to instantiate one of the NeuralNetClassifier and NeuralNetRegressor classes and configure a number of parameters that are passed to their constructor.Note that some parameters need to be prefixed by module__, while others don't. The parameters related to the model must have the prefix, such as the underlying nn.Module. The parameters related to training options do not require the prefix. concrete.ml.sklearn import NeuralNetClassifier
import torch.nn as nn
n_inputs = 10
n_outputs = 2
params = {
"module__n_layers": 2,
"max_epochs": 10,
}
concrete_classifier = NeuralNetClassifier(**params)The Classifier Comparison notebook shows the behavior of built-in neural networks on several synthetic data-sets.The folowing figure shows the Concrete ML neural network trained with Quantization Aware Training in an FHE-compatible configuration and compares it to the floating-point equivalent trained with scikit-learn.Comparison neural networksArchitecture parametersmodule__n_layers: number of layers in the FCNN.This parameter must be at least 1. Note that this is the total number of layers. For a single, hidden layer NN model, set module__n_layers=2module__activation_function: can be one of the Torch activations (such as nn.ReLU)See the full list of Torch activations here.Neural networks with nn.ReLU activation benefit from specific optimizations that make them around 10x faster than networks with other activation functions.Quantization parametersn_w_bits (default 3): number of bits for weightsn_a_bits (default 3): number of bits for activations and inputsn_accum_bits: maximum accumulator bit-width that is desiredBy default, this is unbounded, which, for weight and activation bit-width settings, may make the trained networks fail in compilation. When used, the implementation will attempt to keep accumulators under this bit-width through pruning (for example, setting some weights to zero).power_of_two_scaling (default True): forces quantization scales to be powers-of-twoWhen coupled with the ReLU activation, this optimize strongly the FHE inference time.See this section in the quantization documentation for more details.Training parameters (from skorch)max_epochs (default 10): The number of epochs to train the networkverbose (default: False): Whether to log loss/metrics during traininglr (default 0.001): Learning rateYou can find other parameters from skorch in the skorch documentation.Advanced parametersmodule__n_hidden_neurons_multiplier (default 4): The number of hidden neurons.This parameter will be automatically set proportional to the dimensionality of the input. It controls the proportionality factor. This value gives good accuracy while avoiding accumulator overflow.See the pruning and quantization sections for more info.Class weightsYou can give weights to each class to use in training. Note that this must be supported by the underlying PyTorch loss function. params["criterion__weight"] = compute_class_weight("balanced", classes=classes, y=y_train)Overflow errorsThe n_accum_bits parameter influences training accuracy by controlling the number of non-zero neurons allowed in each layer. You can increase n_accum_bits to improve accuracy, but must consider the precision limitations to avoid an overflow in the accumulator. The default value is a balanced choice that generally avoids overflow, but you may need to adjust it to reduce the network breadth if you encounter overflow errors.The number of neurons in intermediate layers is controlled by the n_hidden_neurons_multiplier parameter. A value of 1 makes intermediate layers have the same number of neurons as the number as the input data dimensions.PreviousTree-based modelsNextNearest neighborsLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Encrypted training | Concrete ML

Encrypted training | Concrete MLRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageEncrypted trainingThis document explains how to train SGD Logistic Regression on encrypted data.IntroductionTraining on encrypted data is done through an FHE program that is generated by Concrete ML, based on the characteristics of the data that are given to the fit function. Once the FHE program associated with the SGDClassifier object has fit the encrypted data, it performs specifically to that data's distribution and dimensionality.When deploying encrypted training services, you need to consider the type of data that future users of your services will train on:The distribution of the data should match to achieve good accuracyThe dimensionality of the data needs to match since the deployed FHE programs are compiled for a fixed number of dimensions.See the deployment section for more details.Training on encrypted data provides the highest level of privacy but is slower than training on clear data. Federated learning is an alternative approach, where data privacy can be ensured by using a trusted gradient aggregator, coupled with optional differential privacy instead of encryption. Concrete ML can import models trained through federated learning using 3rd party tools. All model types are supported - linear, tree-based and neural networks - through the from_sklearn_model function and the compile_torch_model function.Ciphertext format compatibilityThese models only support Concrete ciphertexts. See the ciphertexts format documentation for more details.ExampleThe logistic regression training example shows logistic regression training on encrypted data in action.The following snippet shows how to instantiate a logistic regression model that trains on encrypted data: concrete.ml.sklearn import SGDClassifier
parameters_range = (-1.0, 1.0)
model = SGDClassifier(
random_state=42,
max_iter=50,
fit_encrypted=True,
parameters_range=parameters_range,
)To activate encrypted training, simply set fit_encrypted=True in the constructor. When the value is set, Concrete ML generates an FHE program which, when called through the fit function, processes encrypted training data, labels and initial weights and outputs trained model weights. If this value is not set, training is performed on clear data using scikit-learn gradient descent.Next, to perform the training on encrypted data, call the fit function with the fhe="execute" argument:Training configurationThe max_iter parameter controls the number of batches that are processed by the training algorithm.The parameters_range parameter determines the initialization of the coefficients and the bias of the logistic regression. It is recommended to give values that are close to the min/max of the training data. It is also possible to normalize the training data so that it lies in the range [−1,1][-1, 1][−1,1].Capabilities and LimitationsThe trainable logistic model uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and quantizes the data, weights, gradients and the error measure. It currently supports training 6-bit models, including g both the coefficients and the bias.The SGDClassifier does not currently support training models with other bit-width values. The execution time to train a model is proportional to the number of features and the number of training examples in the batch. The SGDClassifier training does not currently support client/server deployment for training.DeploymentOnce you have tested an SGDClassifier that trains on encrypted data, you can build an FHE training service by deploying the FHE training program of the SGDClassifier. See the Production Deloyment page for more details on how to the Concrete ML deployment utility classes. To deploy an FHE training program, you must pass the mode='training' parameter to the FHEModelDev class.PreviousEncrypted dataframeNextInferenceLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Our CLA-bot will guide you through the process when you will open a Pull Request on Github.You can also provide new tutorials or use-cases, showing what can be done with the library. The more examples we have, the better and clearer it is for the other users.1. Setting up the projectFirst, you need to fork the Concrete ML repository and properly set up the project by following the steps provided here.2. Creating a new branchWhen creating your branch, make sure the name follows the expected format : checkout -b {feat|fix|docs|chore}/short_description_$(issue_id)
git checkout -b {feat|fix|docs|chore}/$(issue_id)_short_descriptionFor example: checkout -b feat/add_avgpool_operator_470
git checkout -b feat/470_add_avgpool_operator3. Before committing3.1 ConformanceEach commit to Concrete ML should conform to the standards of the project. You can let the development tools fix some issues automatically with the following command:Additionally, you will need to make sure that the following command does not return any error (pcc: pre-commit checks):3.2 TestingYour code must be well documented, provide extensive tests if any feature has been added and must not break other tests.
To execute all tests, please run the following command. Be aware that running all tests can take up to an hour.You need to make sure you get 100% code coverage. The make pytest command checks that by default and will fail with a coverage report at the end should some lines of your code not be executed during testing.If your coverage is below 100%, you should write more tests and then create the pull request. If you ignore this warning and create the PR, checks will fail and your PR will not be merged.There may be cases where covering your code is not possible (an exception that cannot be triggered in normal execution circumstances). In those cases, you may be allowed to disable coverage for some specific lines. This should be the exception rather than the rule, and reviewers will ask why some lines are not covered. If it appears they can be covered, then the PR won't be accepted in that state.4. CommittingConcrete ML uses a consistent commit naming scheme and you are expected to follow it as well. The accepted format can be printed to your terminal by running:For example:git commit -m "fix: fix AVGPool2d operator"Just a reminder that commit messages are checked in the conformance step and are rejected if they don't follow the rules. To learn more about conventional commits, check this page.5. RebasingYou should rebase on top of the repository's main branch before you create your pull request. Merge commits are not allowed, so rebasing on main before pushing gives you the best chance of to avoid rewriting parts of your PR later if conflicts arise with other PRs being merged. After you commit changes to your forked repository, you can use the following commands to rebase your main branch with Concrete ML's one:git remote add upstream [email protected]:zama-ai/concrete-ml.git
# Contributing | Concrete ML
git fetch upstream
# Contributing | Concrete ML
git checkout main
# Contributing | Concrete ML
git rebase upstream/main
# Contributing | Concrete ML
# Contributing | Concrete ML
git rebase --continue
# Contributing | Concrete ML
git push --force origin mainYou can learn more about rebasing here.6. Open a pull-requestYou can now open a pull-request in the Concrete ML repository.

You can also check the outstanding issues on github.Furthermore, undefined behavior may occur if the input-set, which is internally used by the compilation core to set bit-widths of some intermediate data, is not sufficiently representative of the future user inputs. With all the inputs in the input-set, it appears that intermediate data can be represented as an n-bit integer. But, for a particular computation, this same intermediate data needs additional bits to be represented.

This includes adhering to the expected inputs, outputs, and operational semantics.Refer to the ONNX documentation to grasp the expected behavior, inputs and outputs of the operator.Operator MappingAfter implementing the operator in ops_impl.py, you need to import it into onnx_utils.py and map it within the ONNX_OPS_TO_NUMPY_IMPL dictionary. This mapping is crucial for the framework to recognize and utilize the new operator.Quantized OperatorQuantized operators are defined in quantized_ops.py and are used to handle integer arithmetic. Their implementation is required for the new ONNX to be executed in FHE.There exist two types of quantized operators:Univariate Non-Linear Operators: Such operator applies transformation on every element of the input without changing its shape. Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU are examples of such operation. The sigmoid in this file is simply supported as follows: QuantizedSigmoid(QuantizedOp):
"""Quantized sigmoid op."""
_impl_for_op_named: str = "Sigmoid"Linear Layers: Linear layers like Gemm and Conv require specific implementations for integer arithmetic. Please refer to the QuantizedGemm and QuantizedConv implementations for reference.Adding TestsProper testing is essential to ensure the correctness of the new ONNX node support.There are many locations where tests can be added:test_onnx_ops_impl.py: Tests the implementation of the ONNX node in floating points.test_quantized_ops.py: Tests the implementation of the ONNX node in integer arithmetic.Optional: test_compile_torch.py: Tests the implementation of a specific torch model that contains the new ONNX operator. The model needs to be added in torch_models.py.Update DocumentationFinally, update the documentation to reflect the newly supported ONNX node.PreviousContributingLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced Rust setupThis document provides basic instructions to configure the Rust toolchain and features for TFHE-rs.TFHE-rs requires a nightly Rust toolchain to build the C API and utilize advanced SIMD instructions. However, for other uses, a stable toolchain (version 1.84 or later) is sufficient.Follow the following instructions to install the necessary Rust toolchain:
rustup toolchain install stable
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup toolchain install nightlySetting the toolchainYou can set the toolchain using either of the following methods.Manually specify the toolchain for each cargo command:
cargo +stable build --release
cargo +stable test --release
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo +nightly build --release
cargo +nightly test --releaseOverride the toolchain for the current project:
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup override set stable
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo build --release
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup override set nightly
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo build --releaseTo verify the default toolchain used by Cargo, execute:Choosing your featuresTFHE-rs provides various cargo features to customize the types and features used.Homomorphic typesThis crate provides 4 kinds of data types. Each kind is enabled by activating the corresponding feature in the TOML line and has multiple types:BooleansbooleanBooleansShortIntsshortintShort integersIntegersintegerArbitrary-sized integersIntegers+extended-typesNon-standard sized integersStringsstringsASCII stringsThe Integers+ kind refers to types which have non-standard bit-width like FheUint24 for example. Having more granular types can allow to improve performance. The feature is not enabled by default to avoid very long compile times if users don't need the extended-types.AVX-512While the library generally selects automatically the best instruction sets available by the host, in the case of 'AVX-512', you have to choose it explicitly.

Contributing | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingThis document provides guidance on how to contribute to TFHE-rs.There are two ways to contribute:Report issues: Open issues on GitHub to report bugs, suggest improvements, or note typos.Submit codes: To become an official contributor, you must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Our CLA-bot will guide you through this process when you open your first pull request.1. Setting up the projectStart by forking the TFHE-rs repository.Rust version: Ensure that you use a Rust version >= 1.81 to compile TFHE-rs.Incompatibility: AArch64-based machines are not yet supported for Windows as it's currently missing an entropy source to be able to seed the CSPRNGs used in TFHE-rs.Performance: For optimal performance, it is highly recommended to run TFHE-rs code in release mode with cargo's --release flag.To get more details about the library, please refer to the documentation.2. Creating a new branchWhen creating your branch, make sure to use the following format :For example:3. Before committing3.1 LintingEach commit to TFHE-rs should conform to the standards of the project. In particular, every source code, docker or workflows files should be linted to prevent programmatic and stylistic errors.Rust source code linters: clippyTypescript/Javascript source code linters: eslint, prettierTo apply automatic code formatting, run:You can perform linting of all Cargo targets with:3.2 TestingYour contributions must include comprehensive documentation and tests without breaking existing tests. To run pre-commit checks, execute:This command ensure that all the targets in the library are building correctly. For a faster check, use:If you're contributing to GPU code, run also:Unit testing suites are heavy and can require a lot of computing power and RAM availability. Whilst tests are run automatically in continuous integration pipeline, you can run tests locally.All unit tests have a command formatted as:Run make help to display a list of all the commands available.To quickly test your changes locally, follow these steps:Locate where the code has changed.Add (or modify) a Cargo test filter to the corresponding make target in Makefile.Run the target.make test_<something> will print the underlying cargo command in STDOUT. You can quickly test your changes by copy/pasting the command and then modify it to suit your needs.For example, if you made changes in tfhe/src/integer/*, you can test them with the following steps:In test_integer target, replace the filter -- integer:: by -- my_new_test.Run make test_integer.4. CommittingTFHE-rs follows the conventional commit specification to maintain a consistent commit history, essential for Semantic Versioning (semver.org). Commit messages are automatically checked in CI and will be rejected if they do not comply, so make sure that you follow the commit conventions detailed on this page.5. RebasingBefore creating a pull request, rebase your branch on the repository's main branch. Merge commits are not permitted, thus rebasing ensures fewer conflicts and a smoother PR review process.6. Opening a Pull RequestOnce your changes are ready, open a pull request.For instructions on creating a PR from a fork, refer to GitHub's official documentation.7. Continuous integrationBefore a pull request can be merged, several test suites run automatically. Below is an overview of the CI process:title: Continuous Integration Process

Data versioningData serialized with TFHE-rs must remain backward compatible. This is done using the tfhe-versionable crate.If you modify a type that derives Versionize in a backward-incompatible way, an upgrade implementation must be provided.For example, these changes are data breaking:Adding a field to a struct.Changing the order of the fields within a struct or the variants within an enum.Renaming a field of a struct or a variant of an enum.Changing the type of field in a struct or a variant in an enum.On the contrary, these changes are not data breaking:Renaming a type (unless it implements the Named trait).Adding a variant to the end of an enum.Historical data from previous TFHE-rs versions are stored inside utils/tfhe-backward-compat-data. They are used to check on every PR that backward compatibility has been preserved.Example: adding a fieldSuppose you want to add an i32 field to a type named MyType. The original type is defined as:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
}And you want to change it to:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
other_val: i32
}Follow these steps:Navigate to the definition of the dispatch enum of this type. This is the type inside the #[versionize(MyTypeVersions)] macro attribute. In general, this type has the same name as the base type with a Versions suffix. You should find something likeenum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyType)
}Add a new variant to the enum to preserve the previous version of the type. You can simply copy and paste the previous definition of the type and add a version suffix:struct MyTypeV1 {
val: u64,
}
#[derive(VersionsDispatch)]
enum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyTypeV1),
V2(MyType) // Here this points to your modified type
}Implement the Upgrade trait to define how we should go from the previous version to the current version: type Error = Infallible;
fn upgrade(self) -> Result<MyType, Self::Error> {
Ok(MyType {
val: self.val,
other_val: 0
})
}
}Fix the upgrade target of the previous version. In this example, impl Upgrade<MyType> for MyTypeV0 { should simply be changed to impl Upgrade<MyTypeV1> for MyTypeV0 {PreviousTFHE deep diveLast updated 2 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

What is TFHE-rs? | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageWhat is TFHE-rs?TFHE-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) to perform Boolean and integer arithmetic on encrypted data.TFHE-rs implements advanced TFHE features, empowering developers and researchers with fine-grained control over TFHE so that they can focus on high-level functionality without delving into low-level implementation.TFHE-rs includes:Rust API: the primary API for working with TFHE-rs in Rust projects.C API: for developers who prefer to use C.Client-side WASM API: to integrate TFHE-rs functionalities into WebAssembly applications.Key cryptographic conceptsTFHE is a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme based on Learning With Errors (LWE), which is a secure cryptographic primitive against even quantum computers. The TFHE-rs library implements Zama’s variant of TFHE.Homomorphic Encryption BasicsThe basic elements of cryptography:Message (or Cleartext): raw values before encryption.Plaintext: encoded messages.Ciphertext: encrypted messages.FHE allows to compute on ciphertexts without revealing the content of the messages. A scheme is fully homomorphic if it supports at least two of the following operations when evaluating any programs. (xxx is a plaintext and E[x]E[x]E[x] is the corresponding ciphertext):Homomorphic univariate function evaluation: f(E[x])=E[f(x)]f(E[x]) = E[f(x)]f(E[x])=E[f(x)]Homomorphic addition: E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]E[x] + E[y] = E[x + y]E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]Homomorphic multiplication: E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]E[x] * E[y] = E[x * y]E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]Zama's variant of TFHEZama's variant of TFHE is a fully homomorphic scheme that takes fixed-precision numbers as messages. It implements all homomorphic operations needed, such as addition and function evaluation via Programmable Bootstrapping.Refer to the preliminary whitepaper for more details.Using TFHE-rs in Rust includes the following steps:Key generation: generate a pair of keys using secure parameters.Client key: used for encryption and decryption of data. This key must be kept secret.Server key (or Evaluation key): used for performing operations on encrypted data. This key could be public.Encryption: encrypt plaintexts using the client key to produce ciphertexts.Homomorphic operation: perform operations on ciphertexts using the server key.Decryption: decrypt the resulting ciphertexts back to plaintexts using the client key.To understand more about FHE applications, see the 6-minute introduction to homomorphic encryption.PreviousWelcome to TFHE-rsNextInstallationLast updated 2 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# GPU acceleration | TFHE-rs

GPU acceleration | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationTFHE-rs has a CUDA GPU backend that enables faster integer arithmetic operations on encrypted data, when compared to the default CPU backend. This guide explains how to update your existing program to leverage GPU acceleration, or to start a new program using GPU.To explore a simple code example, go to:A simple exampleFHE performance on GPUThe GPU backend is up to 4.2x faster than the CPU one. For a comparison between CPU and GPU latencies, see the following page.BenchmarksDifferent integer operations obtain different speedups. Please refer to the detailed GPU benchmarks of FHE operations for detailed figures.To reproduce TFHE-rs GPU benchmarks, see this dedicated page. To obtain the best performance when running benchmarks, set the environment variable CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER to avoid CUDA API overheads during the first kernel execution. Bear in mind that GPU warmup is necessary before doing performance measurements.GPU TFHE-rs featuresBy default, the GPU backend uses specific cryptographic parameters. When calling the tfhe::ConfigBuilder::default() function, the cryptographic for PBS will be:PBS parameters: PARAM_GPU_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_4_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBSThese PBS parameters are accompanied by the following compression parameters:Compression parameters: COMP_PARAM_GPU_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_4_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBSTFHE-rs uses dedicated parameters for the GPU in order to achieve optimal performance, and the CPU and GPU parameters cannot be mixed to perform computation and compression for security reasons.The GPU backend is designed to speed up server-side FHE operations and supports the following TFHE-rs features:FHE ciphertext operationsCiphertext compressionCiphertext arraysZK-POK proof expansionNoise SquashingMulti-GPU for throughput optimizationThe following features are not supported:Key generationEncryption/decryptionZK-POK proof generation and verificationEncrypted strings and operations on encrypted stringsGPU programming modelThe GPU TFHE-rs integer API is mostly identical to the CPU API: both integer datatypes and operations syntax are the same. All the while, some GPU program design principles must be considered:Key generation, encryption, and decryption are performed on the CPU. When used in operations, ciphertexts are automatically copied to or from the first GPU that the user configures for TFHE-rs.GPU syntax for integer FHE operations, key generation, and serialization is identical with equivalent CPU code.When configured to compile for the GPU, TFHE-rs uses GPU specific cryptographic parameters that give high performance on the GPU. Ciphertexts and server-keys that are generated with CPU parameters can be processed with GPU-enabled TFHE-rs but performance is considerably degraded.Each server key instance is assigned to a set of GPUs, which are automatically used in parallel. To set the active GPUs for a CPU thread, activate the server key assigned to the GPUs you want to use.GPU integer operations are synchronous to the calling thread. To execute in parallel on several GPUs, use Rust parallel constructs such as par_iter.The key differences between the CPU API and the GPU API are:The GPU backend only supports compressed server keys that must be decompressed on a GPU selected by the user.For ciphertext compression the cryptographic parameters must be chosen by the user from the GPU parameter set.For ciphertext arrays, GPU-specific ciphertext array types must be used instead of CPU ones.Project configuration1. PrerequisitesTo compile and execute GPU TFHE-rs programs, make sure your system has the following software installed.Cuda version >= 10Compute Capability >= 3.0gcc >= 8.0 - check this page for more details about nvcc/gcc compatible versionscmake >= 3.24libclang, to match Rust bingen requirements >= 9.0Rust version - see this page2.

WebWhen using the Web WASM target, you should call an additional init function. With parallelism enabled, you need to call another additional initThreadPool function.Example: initThreadPool, // only available with parallelism
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfhePublicKey,
} from "./pkg/tfhe.js";
async function example() {
await init()
await initThreadPool(navigator.hardwareConcurrency);
await init_panic_hook();
const block_params = new ShortintParameters(ShortintParametersName.V1_4_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_COMPACT_PK_PBS_KS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);

}Compiling the WASM APIUse the provided Makefile in the TFHE-rs repository to compile for the desired target:make build_node_js_api for the Node.js APImake build_web_js_api for the browser APImake build_web_js_api_parallel for the browser API with parallelismThe compiled WASM packages are located in tfhe/pkg.The browser API and the Node.js API are available as npm packages. Using npm i tfhe for the browser API and npm i node-tfhe for the Node.js API.Extra steps for web bundlersWhen using the browser API with parallelism, some extra step might be needed depending on the bundler used:Usage with WebpackIf you're using Webpack v5 (version >= 5.25.1), you don't need to do anything special, as it already supports bundling Workers out of the box.Usage with ParcelParcel v2 also recognises the used syntax and works out of the box.Usage with RollupFor Rollup, you'll need @surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread plugin (version >= 2.1.0) which brings the same functionality and was tested with this crate.Alternatively, you can use Vite which has necessary plugins built-in.(Taken from RReverser/wasm-bindgen-rayon)Using the JS on WASM APITFHE-rs uses WASM to provide a JavaScript (JS) binding to the client-side primitives, like key generation and encryption within the Boolean and shortint modules.Currently, there are several limitations. Due to a lack of threading support in WASM, key generation can be too slow to be practical for bigger parameter sets.Some parameter sets lead to the FHE keys exceeding the 2GB memory limit of WASM, making these parameter sets virtually unusable.First steps using TFHE-rs JS on WASM APISetting up TFHE-rs JS on WASM API for Node.js programs.To build the JS on WASM bindings for TFHE-rs, install wasm-pack and the necessary rust toolchain. Cone the TFHE-rs repository and build using the following commands (this will build using the default branch, you can check out a specific tag depending on your requirements):Cloning into 'tfhe-rs'...

# Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic parity bitThis tutorial shows how to build a small function that homomorphically computes a parity bit in 2 steps:Write a non-generic functionUse generics to handle the case where the function inputs are both FheBools and clear bools.The parity bit function processes two parameters:A slice of BooleanA mode (Odd or Even)This function returns a Boolean (true or false) so that the total count of true values across the input and the result matches with the specified parity mode (Odd or Even).Non-generic version
tfhe = { version = "~1.4.1", features = ["integer"] }First, define the verification function.The function initializes the parity bit to false, then applies the XOR operation across all bits, adding negation based on the requested mode.The validation function also adds the number of the bits set in the input to the computed parity bit and checks whether the sum is even or odd, depending on the mode.

}Generic versionTo enable the compute_parity_bit function to operate with both encrypted FheBool and plain bool, we introduce generics. This approach allows for validation using clear data and facilitates debugging.Writing generic functions that incorporate operator overloading for our Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) types is more complex than usual because FHE types do not implement the Copy trait. Consequently, it is necessary to use references (&) with these types, unlike native types, which typically implement Copy.This complicates generic bounds at first.Writing the correct trait boundsThe function has the following signature: fhe_bits: &[FheBool],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> boolTo make it generic, the first steps is: fhe_bits: &[BoolType],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> BoolTypeNext, define the generic bounds with the where clause.In the function, you can use the following operators:! (trait: Not)^ (trait: BitXor)Adding them to where, it gives: BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, the compiler will return an error:error[E0369]: no implementation for `&BoolType ^ BoolType`

error: aborting due to previous errorfhe_bit is a reference to a BoolType (&BoolType), because BoolType is borrowed from the fhe_bits slice during iteration. To fix the error, the first approach could be changing the BitXor bounds to what the Compiler suggests, by requiring &BoolType to implement BitXor rather than BoolType. BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
&BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, this approach still leads to an error:error[E0637]: `&` without an explicit lifetime name cannot be used here

# Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rs

Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageParallelized PBSThis document describes the implementation and benefits of parallelized Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) in TFHE-rs, including code examples for using multi-bit PBS parameters and ensuring deterministic execution.Parallelized Programmable BootstrappingProgrammable Bootstrapping is inherently a sequential operation. However, some recent results showed that introducing parallelism is feasible at the expense of larger keys, thereby enhancing the performance of PBS. This new PBS is called a multi-bit PBS.TFHE-rs can already perform parallel execution of integer homomorphic operations. Activating this feature can lead to performance improvements, particularly in the case of high core-count CPUs when enough cores are available, or when dealing with operations that require small input message precision.The following example shows how to use parallelized bootstrapping by choosing multi-bit PBS parameters: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::current_params::V1_4_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(V1_4_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())
}Deterministic parallelized Programmable BootstrappingBy nature, the parallelized PBS might not be deterministic: while the resulting ciphertext will always decrypt to the correct plaintext, the order of the operations could vary, resulting in different output ciphertext. To ensure a consistent ciphertext output regardless of execution order, add the with_deterministic_execution() suffix to the parameters.Here's an example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::current_params::V1_4_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(
V1_4_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64.with_deterministic_execution(),
)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())

# Contributing | TFHE-rs

Contributing | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingThis document provides guidance on how to contribute to TFHE-rs.There are two ways to contribute:Report issues: Open issues on GitHub to report bugs, suggest improvements, or note typos.Submit codes: To become an official contributor, you must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Our CLA-bot will guide you through this process when you open your first pull request.1. Setting up the projectStart by forking the TFHE-rs repository.Rust version: Ensure that you use a Rust version >= 1.81 to compile TFHE-rs.Incompatibility: AArch64-based machines are not yet supported for Windows as it's currently missing an entropy source to be able to seed the CSPRNGs used in TFHE-rs.Performance: For optimal performance, it is highly recommended to run TFHE-rs code in release mode with cargo's --release flag.To get more details about the library, please refer to the documentation.2. Creating a new branchWhen creating your branch, make sure to use the following format :For example:3. Before committing3.1 LintingEach commit to TFHE-rs should conform to the standards of the project. In particular, every source code, docker or workflows files should be linted to prevent programmatic and stylistic errors.Rust source code linters: clippyTypescript/Javascript source code linters: eslint, prettierTo apply automatic code formatting, run:You can perform linting of all Cargo targets with:3.2 TestingYour contributions must include comprehensive documentation and tests without breaking existing tests. To run pre-commit checks, execute:This command ensure that all the targets in the library are building correctly. For a faster check, use:If you're contributing to GPU code, run also:Unit testing suites are heavy and can require a lot of computing power and RAM availability. Whilst tests are run automatically in continuous integration pipeline, you can run tests locally.All unit tests have a command formatted as:Run make help to display a list of all the commands available.To quickly test your changes locally, follow these steps:Locate where the code has changed.Add (or modify) a Cargo test filter to the corresponding make target in Makefile.Run the target.make test_<something> will print the underlying cargo command in STDOUT. You can quickly test your changes by copy/pasting the command and then modify it to suit your needs.For example, if you made changes in tfhe/src/integer/*, you can test them with the following steps:In test_integer target, replace the filter -- integer:: by -- my_new_test.Run make test_integer.4. CommittingTFHE-rs follows the conventional commit specification to maintain a consistent commit history, essential for Semantic Versioning (semver.org). Commit messages are automatically checked in CI and will be rejected if they do not comply, so make sure that you follow the commit conventions detailed on [this page] (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).5. RebasingBefore creating a pull request, rebase your branch on the repository's main branch. Merge commits are not permitted, thus rebasing ensures fewer conflicts and a smoother PR review process.6. Opening a Pull RequestOnce your changes are ready, open a pull request.For instructions on creating a PR from a fork, refer to GitHub's official documentation.7. Continuous integrationBefore a pull request can be merged, several test suites run automatically. Below is an overview of the CI process:[!Note] Useful details:pipeline is triggered by humansreview team is located in Paris timezone, pipeline launch will most likely happen during office hoursdirect changes to CI related files are not allowed for external contributorsrun make pcc to fix any build errors before pushing commits8. Data versioningData serialized with TFHE-rs must remain backward compatible. This is done using the tfhe-versionable crate.If you modify a type that derives Versionize in a backward-incompatible way, an upgrade implementation must be provided.For example, these changes are data breaking:Adding a field to a struct.Changing the order of the fields within a struct or the variants within an enum.Renaming a field of a struct or a variant of an enum.Changing the type of field in a struct or a variant in an enum.On the contrary, these changes are not data breaking:Renaming a type (unless it implements the Named trait).Adding a variant to the end of an enum.Example: adding a fieldSuppose you want to add an i32 field to a type named MyType. The original type is defined as:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
}And you want to change it to:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
other_val: i32
}Follow these steps:Navigate to the definition of the dispatch enum of this type. This is the type inside the #[versionize(MyTypeVersions)] macro attribute. In general, this type has the same name as the base type with a Versions suffix. You should find something likeenum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyType)
}Add a new variant to the enum to preserve the previous version of the type. You can simply copy and paste the previous definition of the type and add a version suffix:struct MyTypeV1 {
val: u64,
}
#[derive(VersionsDispatch)]
enum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyTypeV1),
V2(MyType) // Here this points to your modified type
}Implement the Upgrade trait to define how we should go from the previous version to the current version: type Error = Infallible;
fn upgrade(self) -> Result<MyType, Self::Error> {
Ok(MyType {
val: self.val,
other_val: 0
})

What is TFHE-rs? | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageWhat is TFHE-rs?TFHE-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) to perform Boolean and integer arithmetic on encrypted data.TFHE-rs implements advanced TFHE features, empowering developers and researchers with fine-grained control over TFHE so that they can focus on high-level functionality without delving into low-level implementation.TFHE-rs includes:Rust API: the primary API for working with TFHE-rs in Rust projects.C API: for developers who prefer to use C.Client-side WASM API: to integrate TFHE-rs functionalities into WebAssembly applications.Key cryptographic conceptsTFHE is a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme based on Learning With Errors (LWE), which is a secure cryptographic primitive against even quantum computers. The TFHE-rs library implements Zama’s variant of TFHE.Homomorphic Encryption BasicsThe basic elements of cryptography:Message (or Cleartext): raw values before encryption.Plaintext: encoded messages.Ciphertext: encrypted messages.FHE allows to compute on ciphertexts without revealing the content of the messages. A scheme is fully homomorphic if it supports at least two of the following operations when evaluating any programs. (xxx is a plaintext and E[x]E[x]E[x] is the corresponding ciphertext):Homomorphic univariate function evaluation: f(E[x])=E[f(x)]f(E[x]) = E[f(x)]f(E[x])=E[f(x)]Homomorphic addition: E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]E[x] + E[y] = E[x + y]E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]Homomorphic multiplication: E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]E[x] * E[y] = E[x * y]E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]Zama's variant of TFHEZama's variant of TFHE is a fully homomorphic scheme that takes fixed-precision numbers as messages. It implements all homomorphic operations needed, such as addition and function evaluation via Programmable Bootstrapping.Refer to the preliminary whitepaper for more details.Using TFHE-rs in Rust includes the following steps:Key generation: generate a pair of keys using secure parameters.Client key: used for encryption and decryption of data. This key must be kept secret.Server key (or Evaluation key): used for performing operations on encrypted data. This key could be public.Encryption: encrypt plaintexts using the client key to produce ciphertexts.Homomorphic operation: perform operations on ciphertexts using the server key.Decryption: decrypt the resulting ciphertexts back to plaintexts using the client key.To understand more about FHE applications, see the 6-minute introduction to homomorphic encryption.PreviousWelcome to TFHE-rsNextInstallationLast updated 7 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

JS on WASM API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageJS on WASM APIThis document outlines how to use the TFHE-rs WebAssembly (WASM) client API for key generation, encryption, and decryption, providing setup examples for Node.js and web browsers.TFHE-rs supports WASM client API, which includes functionality for key generation, encryption, and decryption. However, it does not support FHE computations.TFHE-rs supports 3 WASM targets:Node.js: For use in Node.js applications or packagesWeb: For use in web browsersWeb-parallel: For use in web browsers with multi-threading supportThe core of the API remains the same, requiring only minor changes in the initialization functions.Node.jsExample: {
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfheCompactPublicKey,
TfheCompressedServerKey,
TfheConfigBuilder,
CompactCiphertextList
} = require("/path/to/built/pkg/tfhe.js");
const assert = require("node:assert").strict;
function fhe_uint32_example() {
// Makes it so that if a rust thread panics,
// the error message will be displayed in the console
init_panic_hook();
const U32_MAX = 4294967295;
const block_params = new ShortintParameters(ShortintParametersName.V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_COMPACT_PK_PBS_KS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);
let config = TfheConfigBuilder.default()
.build();
let clientKey = TfheClientKey.generate(config);
let compressedServerKey = TfheCompressedServerKey.new(clientKey);
let publicKey = TfheCompactPublicKey.new(clientKey);
let values = [0, 1, 2394, U32_MAX];
let builder = CompactCiphertextList.builder(publicKey);
for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
builder.push_u32(values[i]);
}
let compact_list = builder.build();
let serialized_list = compact_list.serialize();
let deserialized_list = CompactCiphertextList.deserialize(serialized_list);
let encrypted_list = deserialized_list.expand();
assert.deepStrictEqual(encrypted_list.len(), values.length);
for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++)
{
let decrypted = encrypted_list.get_uint32(i).decrypt(clientKey);
assert.deepStrictEqual(decrypted, values[i]);
}
}
fhe_uint32_example();
WebWhen using the Web WASM target, you should call an additional init function. With parallelism enabled, you need to call another additional initThreadPool function.Example: initThreadPool, // only available with parallelism
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfhePublicKey,
} from "./pkg/tfhe.js";
async function example() {
await init()
await initThreadPool(navigator.hardwareConcurrency);
await init_panic_hook();
const block_params = new ShortintParameters(ShortintParametersName.V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_COMPACT_PK_PBS_KS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);
// ....
}Compiling the WASM APIUse the provided Makefile in the TFHE-rs repository to compile for the desired target:make build_node_js_api for the Node.js APImake build_web_js_api for the browser APImake build_web_js_api_parallel for the browser API with parallelismThe compiled WASM packages are located in tfhe/pkg.The browser API and the Node.js API are available as npm packages. Using npm i tfhe for the browser API and npm i node-tfhe for the Node.js API.Extra steps for web bundlersWhen using the browser API with parallelism, some extra step might be needed depending on the bundler used:Usage with WebpackIf you're using Webpack v5 (version >= 5.25.1), you don't need to do anything special, as it already supports bundling Workers out of the box.Usage with ParcelParcel v2 also recognises the used syntax and works out of the box.Usage with RollupFor Rollup, you'll need @surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread plugin (version >= 2.1.0) which brings the same functionality and was tested with this crate.Alternatively, you can use Vite which has necessary plugins built-in.(Taken from RReverser/wasm-bindgen-rayon)Using the JS on WASM APITFHE-rs uses WASM to provide a JavaScript (JS) binding to the client-side primitives, like key generation and encryption within the Boolean and shortint modules.Currently, there are several limitations. Due to a lack of threading support in WASM, key generation can be too slow to be practical for bigger parameter sets.Some parameter sets lead to the FHE keys exceeding the 2GB memory limit of WASM, making these parameter sets virtually unusable.First steps using TFHE-rs JS on WASM APISetting up TFHE-rs JS on WASM API for Node.js programs.To build the JS on WASM bindings for TFHE-rs, install wasm-pack and the necessary rust toolchain. Cone the TFHE-rs repository and build using the following commands (this will build using the default branch, you can check out a specific tag depending on your requirements):Cloning into 'tfhe-rs'...

$Commented code to generate keys for shortint and encrypt a ciphertextMake sure to update the path of the required clause in the example below to match the location of the TFHE package that was just built.const assert = require('node:assert').strict;
// Import the Shortint module from the TFHE-rs package generated earlier
const { Shortint, ShortintParametersName, ShortintParameters } = require("/path/to/built/tfhe/pkg");
function shortint_example() {
// Get pre-defined parameters from the shortint module to manage messages with 4 bits of useful
// information in total (2 bits of "message" and 2 bits of "carry")
let params_name = ShortintParametersName.PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
let params = new ShortintParameters(params_name);
// Create a new secret ClientKey, this must not be shared
console.log("Generating client keys...")
let cks = Shortint.new_client_key(params);
// Encrypt 3 in a ciphertext
console.log("Encrypting 3...")
let ct = Shortint.encrypt(cks, BigInt(3));
// Demonstrate ClientKey serialization (for example saving it on disk on the user device)
let serialized_cks = Shortint.serialize_client_key(cks);
// Deserialization
let deserialized_cks = Shortint.deserialize_client_key(serialized_cks);
// Demonstrate ciphertext serialization to send over the network
let serialized_ct = Shortint.serialize_ciphertext(ct);
// Deserialize a ciphertext received over the network for example
let deserialized_ct = Shortint.deserialize_ciphertext(serialized_ct);
// Decrypt with the deserialized objects
console.log("Decrypting ciphertext...")
let decrypted = Shortint.decrypt(deserialized_cks, deserialized_ct);
// Check decryption works as expected
assert.deepStrictEqual(decrypted, BigInt(3));
console.log("Decryption successful!")
// Generate public evaluation keys, also called ServerKey
console.log("Generating compressed ServerKey...")
let sks = Shortint.new_compressed_server_key(cks);
// Can be serialized to send over the network to the machine doing the evaluation
let serialized_sks = Shortint.serialize_compressed_server_key(sks);
let deserialized_sks = Shortint.deserialize_compressed_server_key(serialized_sks);
console.log("All done!")
}

# Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic parity bitThis tutorial shows how to build a small function that homomorphically computes a parity bit in 2 steps:Write a non-generic functionUse generics to handle the case where the function inputs are both FheBools and clear bools.The parity bit function processes two parameters:A slice of BooleanA mode (Odd or Even)This function returns a Boolean (true or false) so that the total count of true values across the input and the result matches with the specified parity mode (Odd or Even).Non-generic version
tfhe = { version = "~1.0.0", features = ["integer"] }First, define the verification function.The function initializes the parity bit to false, then applies the XOR operation across all bits, adding negation based on the requested mode.The validation function also adds the number of the bits set in the input to the computed parity bit and checks whether the sum is even or odd, depending on the mode.

}Generic versionTo enable the compute_parity_bit function to operate with both encrypted FheBool and plain bool, we introduce generics. This approach allows for validation using clear data and facilitates debugging.Writing generic functions that incorporate operator overloading for our Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) types is more complex than usual because FHE types do not implement the Copy trait. Consequently, it is necessary to use references (&) with these types, unlike native types, which typically implement Copy.This complicates generic bounds at first.Writing the correct trait boundsThe function has the following signature: fhe_bits: &[FheBool],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> boolTo make it generic, the first steps is: fhe_bits: &[BoolType],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> BoolTypeNext, define the generic bounds with the where clause.In the function, you can use the following operators:! (trait: Not)^ (trait: BitXor)Adding them to where, it gives: BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, the compiler will return an error:error[E0369]: no implementation for `&BoolType ^ BoolType`

error: aborting due to previous errorfhe_bit is a reference to a BoolType (&BoolType), because BoolType is borrowed from the fhe_bits slice during iteration. To fix the error, the first approach could be changing the BitXor bounds to what the Compiler suggests, by requiring &BoolType to implement BitXor rather than BoolType. BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
&BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, this approach still leads to an error:error[E0637]: `&` without an explicit lifetime name cannot be used here

# Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rs

Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageParallelized PBSThis document describes the implementation and benefits of parallelized Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) in TFHE-rs, including code examples for using multi-bit PBS parameters and ensuring deterministic execution.Parallelized Programmable BootstrappingProgrammable Bootstrapping is inherently a sequential operation. However, some recent results showed that introducing parallelism is feasible at the expense of larger keys, thereby enhancing the performance of PBS. This new PBS is called a multi-bit PBS.TFHE-rs can already perform parallel execution of integer homomorphic operations. Activating this feature can lead to performance improvements, particularly in the case of high core-count CPUs when enough cores are available, or when dealing with operations that require small input message precision.The following example shows how to use parallelized bootstrapping by choosing multi-bit PBS parameters: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_0::V1_0_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(V1_0_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())
}Deterministic parallelized Programmable BootstrappingBy nature, the parallelized PBS might not be deterministic: while the resulting ciphertext will always decrypt to the correct plaintext, the order of the operations could vary, resulting in different output ciphertext. To ensure a consistent ciphertext output regardless of execution order, add the with_deterministic_execution() suffix to the parameters.Here's an example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_0::V1_0_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(
V1_0_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64.with_deterministic_execution(),
)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())

GPU acceleration | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationThis guide explains how to update your existing program to leverage GPU acceleration, or to start a new program using GPU.TFHE-rs now supports a GPU backend with CUDA implementation, enabling integer arithmetic operations on encrypted data.PrerequisitesCuda version >= 10Compute Capability >= 3.0gcc >= 8.0 - check this page for more details about nvcc/gcc compatible versionscmake >= 3.24libclang, to match Rust bingen requirements >= 9.0Rust version - check this pageImporting to your projectTo use the TFHE-rs GPU backend in your project, add the following dependency in your Cargo.toml.= { version = "~1.0.1", features = ["boolean", "shortint", "integer", "gpu"] }For optimal performance when using TFHE-rs, run your code in release mode with the --release flag.Supported platformsTFHE-rs GPU backend is supported on Linux (x86, aarch64).LinuxSupportedSupported*macOSUnsupportedUnsupported*WindowsUnsupportedUnsupportedA first exampleConfiguring and creating keys.Comparing to the CPU example, GPU set up differs in the key creation, as detailed hereHere is a full example (combining the client and server parts):use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let gpu_key = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
//Server-side
set_server_key(gpu_key);
let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}Beware that when the GPU feature is activated, when calling: let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();, the cryptographic parameters differ from the CPU ones, used when the GPU feature is not activated. Indeed, TFHE-rs uses dedicated parameters for the GPU in order to achieve better performance.Setting the keysThe configuration of the key is different from the CPU. More precisely, if both client and server keys are still generated by the client (which is assumed to run on a CPU), the server key has then to be decompressed by the server to be converted into the right format. To do so, the server should run this function: decompressed_to_gpu().Once decompressed, the operations between CPU and GPU are identical.EncryptionOn the client-side, the method to encrypt the data is exactly the same than the CPU one, as shown in the following example: let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);ComputationThe server first need to set up its keys with set_server_key(gpu_key).Then, homomorphic computations are performed using the same approach as the CPU operations. set_server_key(gpu_key);
let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);DecryptionFinally, the client decrypts the results using:List of available operationsThe GPU backend includes the following operations for both signed and unsigned encrypted integers:namesymbolEnc/EncEnc/ IntNeg-✔️N/AAdd+✔️✔️Sub-✔️✔️Mul*✔️✔️Div/✔️✔️Rem%✔️✔️Not!✔️N/ABitAnd&✔️✔️BitOr|✔️✔️BitXor^✔️✔️Shr>>✔️✔️Shl<<✔️✔️Rotate rightrotate_right✔️✔️Rotate leftrotate_left✔️✔️Minmin✔️✔️Maxmax✔️✔️Greater thangt✔️✔️Greater or equal thange✔️✔️Lower thanlt✔️✔️Lower or equal thanle✔️✔️Equaleq✔️✔️Cast (into dest type)cast_into✖️N/ACast (from src type)cast_from✖️N/ATernary operatorselect✔️✖️All operations follow the same syntax than the one described in here.Multi-GPU supportTFHE-rs supports platforms with multiple GPUs. There is nothing to change in the code to execute on such platforms. To keep the API as user-friendly as possible, the configuration is automatically set, i.e., the user has no fine-grained control over the number of GPUs to be used.BenchmarkPlease refer to the GPU benchmarks for detailed performance benchmark results.WarningWhen measuring GPU times on your own on Linux, set the environment variable CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER to avoid CUDA API overheads during the first kernel execution.Compressing ciphertexts after some homomorphic computation on the GPUYou can compress ciphertexts using the GPU, even after computations, just like on the CPU.The way to do it is very similar to how it's done on the CPU. The following example shows how to compress and decompress a list containing 4 messages:One 32-bits integerOne 64-bit integerOne BooleanOne 2-bit integeruse tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, PARAM_GPU_MULTI_BIT_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_GROUP_3_KS_PBS,
};
use tfhe::{
set_server_key, CompressedCiphertextList, CompressedCiphertextListBuilder, FheBool,
FheInt64, FheUint16, FheUint2, FheUint32,
};
fn main() {
let config =
tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(PARAM_GPU_MULTI_BIT_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_GROUP_3_KS_PBS)
.enable_compression(COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.build();
let ck = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = tfhe::CompressedServerKey::new(&ck);
let gpu_key = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
set_server_key(gpu_key);
let ct1 = FheUint32::encrypt(17_u32, &ck);
let ct2 = FheInt64::encrypt(-1i64, &ck);
let ct3 = FheBool::encrypt(false, &ck);
let ct4 = FheUint2::encrypt(3u8, &ck);
let compressed_list = CompressedCiphertextListBuilder::new()
.push(ct1)
.push(ct2)
.push(ct3)
.push(ct4)
.build()
.unwrap();
let serialized = bincode::serialize(&compressed_list).unwrap();
println!("Serialized size: {} bytes", serialized.len());
let compressed_list: CompressedCiphertextList = bincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
let a: FheUint32 = compressed_list.get(0).unwrap().unwrap();
let b: FheInt64 = compressed_list.get(1).unwrap().unwrap();
let c: FheBool = compressed_list.get(2).unwrap().unwrap();
let d: FheUint2 = compressed_list.get(3).unwrap().unwrap();
let a: u32 = a.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(a, 17);
let b: i64 = b.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(b, -1);
let c = c.decrypt(&ck);
assert!(!c);
let d: u8 = d.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(d, 3);
}Array typesIt is possible to use array types on GPU, just as on CPU. Here is an example showing how to do it:use tfhe::array::GpuFheUint32Array;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let cks = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&cks);
let gpu_key = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
set_server_key(gpu_key);
let num_elems = 4 * 4;
let clear_xs = (0..num_elems as u32).collect::<Vec<_>>();
let clear_ys = vec![1u32; num_elems];
// Encrypted 2D array with values
// [[ 0, 1, 2, 3]
// [ 4, 5, 6, 7]
// [ 8, 9, 10, 11]
// [ 12, 13, 14, 15]]
let xs = GpuFheUint32Array::try_encrypt((clear_xs.as_slice(), vec![4, 4]), &cks).unwrap();
// Encrypted 2D array with values
// [[ 1, 1, 1, 1]
// [ 1, 1, 1, 1]
// [ 1, 1, 1, 1]
// [ 1, 1, 1, 1]]
let ys = GpuFheUint32Array::try_encrypt((clear_ys.as_slice(), vec![4, 4]), &cks).unwrap();
assert_eq!(xs.num_dim(), 2);
assert_eq!(xs.shape(), &[4, 4]);
assert_eq!(ys.num_dim(), 2);
assert_eq!(ys.shape(), &[4, 4]);
// Take a sub slice
// [[ 10, 11]
// [ 14, 15]]
let xss = xs.slice(&[2..4, 2..4]);
// Take a sub slice
// [[ 1, 1]
// [ 1, 1]]
let yss = ys.slice(&[2..4, 2..4]);
assert_eq!(xss.num_dim(), 2);
assert_eq!(xss.shape(), &[2, 2]);
assert_eq!(yss.num_dim(), 2);
assert_eq!(yss.shape(), &[2, 2]);
let r = &xss + &yss;
// Result is
// [[ 11, 12]
// [ 15, 16]]
let result: Vec<u32> = r.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(result, vec![11, 12, 15, 16]);
// Clear 2D array with values
// [[ 10, 20]
// [ 30, 40]]
let clear_array = ClearArray::new(vec![10u32, 20u32, 30u32, 40u32], vec![2, 2]);
let r = &xss + &clear_array;
// Result is
// [[ 20, 31]
// [ 44, 55]]
let r: Vec<u32> = r.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(r, vec![20, 31, 44, 55]);

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore crypto APIQuick startThe core_crypto module from TFHE-rs is dedicated to the implementation of the cryptographic tools related to TFHE. To construct an FHE application, the shortint and/or Boolean modules (based on core_crypto) are recommended.The core_crypto module offers an API to low-level cryptographic primitives and objects, like lwe_encryption or rlwe_ciphertext. The goal is to propose an easy-to-use API for cryptographers.The overall code architecture is split in two parts: one for entity definitions and another focused on algorithms. The entities contain the definition of useful types, like LWE ciphertext or bootstrapping keys. The algorithms are then naturally defined to work using these entities.The API is convenient to add or modify existing algorithms, or to have direct access to the raw data. Even if the LWE ciphertext object is defined, along with functions giving access to the body, it is also possible to bypass these to get directly the ithi^{th}ith element of LWE mask.For instance, the code to encrypt and then decrypt a message looks like: tfhe::core_crypto::prelude::*;
// DISCLAIMER: these toy example parameters are not guaranteed to be secure or yield correct
// computations
// Define parameters for LweCiphertext creation
let lwe_dimension = LweDimension(742);
let lwe_noise_distribution =
Gaussian::from_dispersion_parameter(StandardDev(0.000007069849454709433), 0.0);
let ciphertext_modulus = CiphertextModulus::new_native();

let seeder = seeder.as_mut();

&mut lwe,
plaintext,
lwe_noise_distribution,
&mut encryption_generator,
);
let decrypted_plaintext = decrypt_lwe_ciphertext(&lwe_secret_key, &lwe);

// First create a decomposer working on the high 4 bits corresponding to our encoding.
let decomposer = SignedDecomposer::new(DecompositionBaseLog(4), DecompositionLevelCount(1));
let rounded = decomposer.closest_representable(decrypted_plaintext.0);
// Remove the encoding
let cleartext = rounded >> 60;

# Boolean | TFHE-rs

Boolean | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanIn tfhe::boolean, the available operations are mainly related to their equivalent Boolean gates (i.e., AND, OR... etc). What follows are examples of a unary gate (NOT) and a binary gate (XOR). The last one is about the ternary MUX gate, which allows homomorphic computation of conditional statements of the form If..Then..Else.This library is meant to be used both on the server side and the client side. The typical use case should follow the subsequent steps:On the client side, generate the client and server keys.Send the server key to the server.Then any number of times:On the client side, encrypt the input data with the client key.Transmit the encrypted input to the server.On the server side, perform homomorphic computation with the server key.Transmit the encrypted output to the client.On the client side, decrypt the output data with the client key.SetupIn the first step, the client creates two keys, the client key and the server key, with the tfhe::boolean::gen_keys function: tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate the client key and the server key,
// using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key): (ClientKey, ServerKey) = gen_keys();
}The client_key is of type ClientKey. It is secret and must never be transmitted. This key will only be used to encrypt and decrypt data.The server_key is of type ServerKey. It is a public key and can be shared with any party. This key has to be sent to the server because it is required for homomorphic computation.Note that both the client_key and server_key implement the Serialize and Deserialize traits. This way you can use any compatible serializer to store/send the data. To store the server_key in a binary file, you can use the bincode library:use std::io::{Write, Read};
use tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE ----------------------------
// We generate a client key and a server key, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
// We serialize the server key to bytes, and store them in a file:
let encoded: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&server_key).unwrap();
// Create a tmp dir with the current user name to avoid cluttering the /tmp dir
let user = std::env::var("USER").unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_user".to_string());
let tmp_dir_for_user = &format!("/tmp/{user}");
create_dir_all(tmp_dir_for_user).unwrap();
let server_key_file = &format!("{tmp_dir_for_user}/tutorial_server_key.bin");
// We write the server key to a file:
let mut file = File::create(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to create server key file");
file.write_all(encoded.as_slice()).expect("failed to write key to file");
// ...
// We send the key to server side
// ...
//---------------------------- SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We read the file:
let mut file = File::open(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to open server key file");
let mut encoded: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
file.read_to_end(&mut encoded).expect("failed to read key");
// We deserialize the server key:
let key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize(&encoded[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
}Encrypting inputsOnce the server key is available on the server side, it is possible to perform some homomorphic computations. The client needs to encrypt some data and send it to the server. Again, the Ciphertext type implements the Serialize and the Deserialize traits, so that any serializer and communication tool suiting your use case can be employed:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE
// We use the client key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts:
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server somehow
// ...
}Encrypting inputs using a public keyAnyone (the server or a third party) with the public key can also encrypt some (or all) of the inputs. The public key can only be used to encrypt, not to decrypt.
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//---------------------------- SERVER or THIRD_PARTY SIDE
// We use the public key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts (if not on the server already):
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server to be deserialized (if not on the server already)
// ...
}Executing a Boolean circuitOnce the encrypted inputs are on the server side, the server_key can be used to homomorphically execute the desired Boolean circuit:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We deserialize the ciphertexts:
let ct_1: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_1[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
let ct_2: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_2[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// We use the server key to execute the boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);
// Then we serialize the output of the circuit:
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6)
.expect("failed to serialize output");
// ...
// And we send the output to the client
// ...
}Decrypting the outputOnce the encrypted output is on the client side, the client_key can be used to decrypt it:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_6 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON CLIENT SIDE
// We deserialize the output ciphertext:
let output: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_output[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// Finally, we decrypt the output:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&output);
// And check that the result is the expected one:
assert!(output);

The steps to homomorphically evaluate an integer circuit are described here.Key Typesinteger provides 3 basic key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages, thus this key is meant to be kept private and should never be shared. This key is created from parameter values that will dictate both the security and efficiency of computations. The parameters also set the maximum number of bits of message encrypted in a ciphertext.The ServerKey is the key that is used to actually do the FHE computations. It contains a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key. This key is created from a ClientKey that needs to be shared to the server, so it is not meant to be kept private. A user with a ServerKey can compute on the encrypted data sent by the owner of the associated ClientKey.To reflect this, computation/operation methods are tied to the ServerKey type.The PublicKey is a key used to encrypt messages. It can be publicly shared to allow users to encrypt data such that only the ClientKey holder will be able to decrypt. Encrypting with the PublicKey does not alter the homomorphic capabilities associated to the ServerKey.1. Key GenerationTo generate the keys, a user needs two parameters:A set of shortint cryptographic parameters.The number of ciphertexts used to encrypt an integer (we call them "shortint blocks").We are now going to build a pair of keys that can encrypt 8-bit integers (signed or unsigned) by using 4 shortint blocks that store 2 bits of message each.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}2. Encrypting valuesOnce we have our keys, we can encrypt values:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}3. Encrypting values with the public keyOnce the client key is generated, the public key can be derived and used to encrypt data.use tfhe::integer::PublicKey;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
//We generate the public key from the secret client key:
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//encryption
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the public key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg1, num_block);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg2, num_block);
}4. Computing and decryptingWith our server_key, and encrypted values, we can now do an addition and then decrypt the result.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128;
let msg2 = 13;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.add_parallelized(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsQuick startThis library makes it possible to execute homomorphic operations over encrypted data, where the data are either Booleans, short integers (named shortint in the rest of this documentation), or integers up to 256 bits. It allows you to execute a circuit on an untrusted server because both circuit inputs and outputs are kept private. Data are indeed encrypted on the client side, before being sent to the server. On the server side, every computation is performed on ciphertexts.The server, however, has to know the circuit to be evaluated. At the end of the computation, the server returns the encryption of the result to the user. Then the user can decrypt it with the secret key.General method to write an homomorphic circuit programThe overall process to write an homomorphic program is the same for all types. The basic steps for using the TFHE-rs library are the following:Choose a data type (Boolean, shortint, integer)Import the libraryCreate client and server keysEncrypt data with the client keyCompute over encrypted data using the server keyDecrypt data with the client keyAPI levels.This library has different modules, with different levels of abstraction.There is the core_crypto module, which is the lowest level API with the primitive functions and types of the TFHE scheme.Above the core_crypto module, there are the Boolean, shortint, and integer modules, which contain easy to use APIs enabling evaluation of Boolean, short integer, and integer circuits.Finally, there is the high-level module built on top of the Boolean, shortint, integer modules. This module is meant to abstract cryptographic complexities: no cryptographical knowledge is required to start developing an FHE application. Another benefit of the high-level module is the drastically simplified development process compared to lower level modules.high-level APITFHE-rs exposes a high-level API by default that includes datatypes that try to match Rust's native types by having overloaded operators (+, -, ...).Here is an example of how the high-level API is used:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
let result = a + b;
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}Boolean exampleHere is an example of how the library can be used to evaluate a Boolean circuit:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
// We use the client secret key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
// We use the server public key to execute a boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_6);
assert!(output);
}shortint exampleHere is a full example using shortint:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
// using parameters with 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry

let msg2 = 0;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;

let ct_3 = server_key.add(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 + msg2) % modulus);
}integer exampleUse the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2;
fn main() {
// We generate keys to encrypt 16 bits radix-encoded integers
// using 8 blocks of 2 bits
let (cks, sks) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, 8);
let clear_a = 2382u16;
let clear_b = 29374u16;
let mut a = cks.encrypt(clear_a as u64);
let mut b = cks.encrypt(clear_b as u64);
let encrypted_max = sks.smart_max_parallelized(&mut a, &mut b);
let decrypted_max: u64 = cks.decrypt(&encrypted_max);
assert_eq!(decrypted_max as u16, clear_a.max(clear_b))
}The library is simple to use and can evaluate homomorphic circuits of arbitrary length.

Shortint | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortinttfhe::shortint is dedicated to the manipulation of small unsigned integers that fit in a single LWE ciphertext. The actual size depends on the chosen parameters, but is always smaller than 8 bits. For example, with the PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameters, you can encode messages of 2 bits inside a shortint.The integer and high-level API leverage shortints to allow homomorphic computations over larger integers.The steps to homomorphically evaluate a shortint circuit are described below.Key generationtfhe::shortint provides 3 key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages (small integer values).

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintOperationsThe structure and operations related to short integers are described in this section.How a shortint is representedIn shortint, the encrypted data is stored in an LWE ciphertext.Conceptually, the message stored in an LWE ciphertext is divided into a carry buffer and a message buffer.The message buffer is the space where the actual message is stored. This represents the modulus of the input messages (denoted by MessageModulus in the code). When doing computations on a ciphertext, the encrypted message can overflow the message modulus. The part of the message which exceeds the message modulus is stored in the carry buffer. The size of the carry buffer is defined by another modulus, called CarryModulus.Together, the message modulus and the carry modulus form the plaintext space that is available in a ciphertext. This space cannot be overflowed, otherwise the computation may result in an incorrect output.In order to ensure the correctness of the computation, we track the maximum value encrypted in a ciphertext via an associated attribute called the degree. When the degree reaches a defined threshold, the carry buffer may be emptied to safely resume the computations. In shortint the carry modulus is considered useful as a means to do more computations.Types of operationsThe operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted valuesscalar operations that take at least one non-encrypted value as inputFor example, the addition has two variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (a so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space. Using this operation might have an impact on the correctness of the following operations;checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely;smart: always does the operation. If the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will clear the carry to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is to allow the modification of the carry, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value;default: always does the operation and always clears the carry. Could be slower than smart, but it ensures that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use operation typesLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of operations that we have already introduced. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavour may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise,checked and smart are the best options.Let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and a multiplication.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
println!("expected {}, found {}", ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus, output);
}During this computation, the carry buffer has been overflowed and, as all the operations were unchecked, the output may be incorrect.If we redo this same circuit with the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use std::error::Error;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ops = || -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
server_key.checked_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar)?;
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2)?;
server_key.checked_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2)?;
Ok(())
};
match ops() {
Ok(_) => (),
Err(e) => {
println!("correctness of operations is not guaranteed due to error: {}", e);
return;
},
}
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be cleaned during the computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.smart_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings as long as this is the only kind of operation which is used.Using default could slow-down computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}#List of available operationsCertain operations can only be used if the parameter set chosen is compatible with the bivariate programmable bootstrapping, meaning the carry buffer is larger than or equal to the message buffer. These operations are marked with a star (*).The list of implemented operations for shortint is:addition between two ciphertextsaddition between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalarcomparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalardivision of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarLSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the result truncated to fit in the message buffermultiplication of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarbitwise shift <<, >>subtraction of a ciphertext by another ciphertextsubtraction of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarnegation of a ciphertextbitwise and, or and xor (*)comparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between two ciphertexts (*)division between two ciphertexts (*)MSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the part overflowing the message buffer (*)Public key encryption.TFHE-rs supports both private and public key encryption methods. The only difference between both lies in the encryption step: in this case, the encryption method is called using public_key instead of client_key.Here is a small example on how to use public encryption:
fn main() {
// Generate the client key and the server key:
let (cks, _) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let pks = PublicKey::new(&cks);
let msg = 2;
// Encryption of one message:
let ct = pks.encrypt(msg);
// Decryption:
let dec = cks.decrypt(&ct);
assert_eq!(dec, msg);
}Arithmetic operations.Classical arithmetic operations are supported by shortint:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_add(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 + msg2) % modulus);
}bitwise operationsShort homomorphic integer types support some bitwise operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to homomorphically compute a bitwise AND:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_bitand(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 & msg2) % modulus);
}comparisonsShort homomorphic integer types support comparison operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_greater_or_equal(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 >= msg2) as u64 % modulus);
}univariate function evaluationsA simple example on how to use this operation to homomorphically compute the hamming weight (i.e., the number of bits equal to one) of an encrypted number.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
// We use the private client key to encrypt a message:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
// Compute the lookup table for the univariate function:
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table(|n| n.count_ones().into());
// Apply the table lookup on the input message:
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table(&ct_1, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, msg1.count_ones() as u64);
}bi-variate function evaluationsUsing the shortint types offers the possibility to evaluate bi-variate functions, or functions that take two ciphertexts as input. This requires choosing a parameter set such that the carry buffer size is at least as large as the message (i.e., PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with X <= Y).Here is a simple code example:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// Compute the lookup table for the bivariate functions
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table_bivariate(|x,y| (x.count_ones()
+ y.count_ones()) as u64 % modulus );
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table_bivariate(&ct_1, &ct_2, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1.count_ones() as u64 + msg2.count_ones() as u64) % modulus);

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintCryptographic parametersAll parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator, with an error probability equal to 2−642^{-64}2−64 when using programmable bootstrapping. This error probability is due to the randomness added at each encryption (see here for more details about the encryption process).Parameters and message precisionshortint comes with sets of parameters that permit the use of the library functionalities securely and efficiently. Each parameter set is associated to the message and carry precisions. Therefore, each key pair is entangled to precision.The user is allowed to choose which set of parameters to use when creating the pair of keys.The difference between the parameter sets is the total amount of space dedicated to the plaintext, how it is split between the message buffer and the carry buffer, and the order in which the keyswitch (KS) and bootstrap (PBS) are computed. The syntax chosen for the name of a parameter is: PARAM_MESSAGE_{number of message bits}_CARRY_{number of carry bits}_{KS_PBS | PBS_KS}. For example, the set of parameters for a message buffer of 5 bits, a carry buffer of 2 bits and where the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrap is PARAM_MESSAGE_5_CARRY_2_KS_PBS.Note that the KS_PBS order should have better performance at the expense of ciphertext size, PBS_KS is the opposite.This example contains keys that are generated to have messages encoded over 2 bits (i.e., computations are done modulus 22=42^2 = 422=4) with 2 bits of carry.The PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameter set is the default shortint parameter set that you can also use through the tfhe::shortint::prelude::DEFAULT_PARAMETERS constant. tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Impact of parameters on the operationsAs shown here, the choice of the parameter set impacts the operations available and their efficiency.Generic bi-variate functions.The computations of bi-variate functions is based on a trick: concatenating two ciphertexts into one. Where the carry buffer is not at least as large as the message buffer, this trick no longer works. In this case, many bi-variate operations, such as comparisons, cannot be correctly computed. The only exception concerns multiplication.Multiplication.In the case of multiplication, two algorithms are implemented: the first one relies on the bi-variate function trick, where the other one is based on the quarter square method. To correctly compute a multiplication, the only requirement is to have at least one bit of carry (i.e., using parameter sets PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with Y>=1). This method is slower than using the other one. Using the smart version of the multiplication automatically chooses which algorithm is used depending on the chosen parameters.User-defined parameter setsIt is possible to define new parameter sets. To do so, it is sufficient to use the function new() or to manually fill the ClassicPBSParameters structure fields.For instance:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::DynamicDistribution;
fn main() {
// WARNING: might be insecure and/or incorrect
// You can create your own set of parameters
let param = ClassicPBSParameters {

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanCryptographic parametersDefault parametersThe TFHE cryptographic scheme relies on a variant of Regev cryptosystem and is based on a problem so difficult that it is even post-quantum resistant.Some cryptographic parameters will require tuning to ensure both the correctness of the result and the security of the computation.To make it simpler, we've provided two sets of parameters, which ensure correct computations for a certain probability with the standard security of 128 bits. There exists an error probability due to the probabilistic nature of the encryption, which requires adding randomness (noise) following a Gaussian distribution. If this noise is too large, the decryption will not give a correct result. There is a trade-off between efficiency and correctness: generally, using a less efficient parameter set (in terms of computation time) leads to a smaller risk of having an error during homomorphic evaluation.In the two proposed sets of parameters, the only difference lies in this error probability. The default parameter set ensures an error probability of at most 2−642^{-64}2−64 when computing a programmable bootstrapping (i.e., any gates but the not). The other one is closer to the error probability claimed in the original TFHE paper, namely 2−1652^{-165}2−165, but it is up-to-date regarding security requirements.The following array summarizes this:DEFAULT_PARAMETERS2−642^{-64}2−64TFHE_LIB_PARAMETERS2−1652^{-165}2−165User-defined parametersYou can also create your own set of parameters.

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerOperationsThe structure and operations related to integers are described in this section.How an integer is representedIn integer, the encrypted data is split amongst many ciphertexts encrypted with the shortint library. Below is a scheme representing an integer composed by k shortint ciphertexts.This crate implements two ways to represent an integer:the Radix representationthe CRT (Chinese Reminder Theorem) representationRadix-based integers.The first possibility to represent a large integer is to use a Radix-based decomposition on the plaintexts. Let B∈NB \in \mathbb{N}B∈N be a basis such that the size of BBB is smaller than (or equal to) 4 bits. Then, an integer m∈Nm \in \mathbb{N}m∈N can be written as m=m0+m1∗B+m2∗B2+...m = m_0 + m_1*B + m_2*B^2 + ...m=m0​+m1​∗B+m2​∗B2+..., where each mim_imi​ is strictly smaller than BBB. Each mim_imi​ is then independently encrypted. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.The definition of an integer requires a basis and a number of blocks. These parameters are chosen at key generation. Below, the keys are dedicated to integers encrypting messages over 8 bits, using a basis over 2 bits (i.e., B=22B=2^2B=22) and 4 blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}In this representation, the correctness of operations requires the carries to be propagated throughout the ciphertext. This operation is costly, since it relies on the computation of many programmable bootstrapping operations over shortints.CRT-based integers.The second approach to represent large integers is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this case, the basis BBB is composed of several integers bib_ibi​, such that there are pairwise coprime, and each b_ib\_ib_i has a size smaller than 4 bits. The CRT-based integer are defined modulus ∏bi\prod b_i∏bi​. For an integer mmm, its CRT decomposition is simply defined as m mod b0,m mod b1,...m \bmod{b_0}, m \bmod{b_1}, ...mmodb0​,mmodb1​,.... Each part is then encrypted as a shortint ciphertext. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.In the following example, the chosen basis is B=[2,3,5]B = [2, 3, 5]B=[2,3,5]. The integer is defined modulus 2∗3∗5=302*3*5 = 302∗3∗5=30. There is no need to pre-size the number of blocks since it is determined from the number of values composing the basis. Here, the integer is split over three blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let basis = vec![2, 3, 5];
let cks = CrtClientKey::new(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, basis);
}This representation has many advantages: no carry propagation is required, cleaning the carry buffer of each ciphertext block is enough. This implies that operations can easily be parallelized. It also allows the efficient computation of PBS in the case where the function is CRT-compliant.A variant of the CRT is proposed where each block might be associated to a different key couple. Here, a keychain to the computations is required, but this may result in a performance improvement.List of available operationsThe list of operations available in integer depends on the type of representation:Negation✔️✔️Addition✔️✔️Scalar Addition✔️✔️Subtraction✔️✔️Scalar Subtraction✔️✔️Multiplication✔️✔️Scalar Multiplication✔️✔️Bitwise OR, AND, XOR✔️✔️Equality✔️✔️Left/Right Shift✔️✖️Comparisons <,<=,>, >=✔️✖️Min, Max✔️✖️Types of operationsMuch like shortint, the operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted values.scalar operations take at least one non-encrypted value as input.For example, the addition has both variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (the so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space.checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely.smart: always does the operation, if the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will propagate the carry buffer to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is because the inputs' carry might be cleaned, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value.default: always compute the operation and always clear the carry. Could be slower than smart, but ensure that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use each operation typeLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of already introduced operations. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavor may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise, checked and smart are the best options.As an example, let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and an addition.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
// The carry buffer has been overflowed, the result is not correct
assert_ne!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}During this computation the carry buffer has been overflowed, and the output may be incorrect as all the operations were unchecked.If the same circuit is done but using the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 2;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.checked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar).unwrap();
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2).unwrap();
let result = server_key.checked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
assert!(result.is_err());
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
// Only the scalar multiplication could be done
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar) - msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits the manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be propagated during the computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.smart_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}You must avoid cloning the inputs when calling smart operations to preserve performance. For instance, you SHOULD NOT have these kind of patterns in the code:The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings, as long as only this kind of operation is used. Only the parallelized version of the operations is provided.Using default could slow down computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;

let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);

# Debugging | TFHE-rs

Debugging | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingDebuggingThis document explains a feature to facilitate debugging.Starting from TFHE-rs 0.5, trivial ciphertexts introduce a new feature to facilitate debugging. This feature supports a debugger, print statements, and faster execution, significantly reducing waiting time and enhancing the development pace of FHE applications.Trivial ciphertexts are not secure. An application released/deployed in production must never receive trivial ciphertext from a client.To use this feature, simply call your circuits/functions with trivially encrypted values that are created using encrypt_trivial(instead of real encryptions that are created using encrypt): tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{set_server_key, generate_keys, ConfigBuilder, FheUint128};
fn mul_all(a: &FheUint128, b: &FheUint128, c: &FheUint128) -> FheUint128 {
// Use the debug format ('{:?}'), if you don't want to unwrap()
// and panic if the value is not a trivial.
println!(
"a: {:?}, b: {:?}, c: {:?}",
a.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
b.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
c.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
);
let tmp = a * b;
println!("a * b = {:?}", tmp.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>());
tmp * c
}
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default().build());
set_server_key(sks);
let a = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(1234u128);
let b = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(4567u128);
let c = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(89101112u128);
// since all inputs are trivially encrypted, this is going to be
// much faster
let result = mul_all(&a, &b, &c);
}This example is going to print:a * b = Ok(5635678)If any input to mul_all is not a trivial ciphertexts, the computations will be done 100% in FHE, and the program will output:a * b = Err(NotTrivialCiphertextError)Using trivial encryptions as input, the example runs in 980 ms on a standard 12-core laptop, compared to 7.5 seconds on a 128-core machine using real encryptions.PreviousGeneric trait boundsNextAdvanced Rust setupLast updated 7 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# PBS statistics | TFHE-rs

PBS statistics | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingPBS statisticsThis document explains how to use the PBS statistics feature in TFHE-rs' shortint API to assess the overall computational intensity in FHE applications.The shortint API now includes a global counter to track the number of Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) executed with the pbs-stats feature. This feature enables precise tracking of PBS executions in a circuit. It helps to estimate the overall compute intensity of FHE code using either the shortint, integer, or High-Level APIs.To know how many PBSes were executed, call get_pbs_count. To reset the PBS count, call reset_pbs_count. You can combine two functions to understand how many PBSes were executed in each part of your code.When combined with the debug mode, this feature allows for quick estimations during iterations on the FHE code.Here is an example of how to use the PBS counter: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::*;
pub fn main() {
// Config and key generation
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Encryption
let a = FheUint32::encrypt(42u32, &cks);
let b = FheUint32::encrypt(16u32, &cks);
// Set the server key
set_server_key(sks);
// Compute and get the PBS count for the 32 bits multiplication
let c = &a * &b;
let mul_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Reset the PBS count, and get the PBS count for a 32 bits bitwise AND
reset_pbs_count();
let d = &a & &b;
let and_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Display the result
println!("mul_32_count: {mul_32_count}");
println!("and_32_count: {and_32_count}");

# Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rs

Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingGeneric trait boundsThis document serves as a practical reference for implementing generic functions in Rust that use operators across mixed references and values. The following explanations help you to understand the trait bounds necessary to handle such operations.Operators such as +, *, >>, and so on are tied to traits in std:::ops. For instance, the + operator corresponds to std::ops::Add. When writing a generic function that uses the + operator, you need to specify std::ops::Add as a trait bound.The trait bound varies slightly depending on whether the left-hand side / right-hand side is an owned value or a reference. The following table shows the different scenarios:T $op TT: $Op<T, Output=T>T $op &TT: for<'a> $Op<&'a T, Output=T>&T $op Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<T, Output=T>&T $op &Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<&'a T, Output=T>The for<'a> syntax refers to the Higher-Rank Trait Bounds(HRTB).Using generic functions allows for clearer input handling, which simplifies the debugging.Example std::ops::{Add, Mul};

You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=stringsStrings are not yet compatible with CompactCiphertextList and CompressedCiphertextListSupported OperationsA variety of common operations are supported for FheAsciiString. These include:Comparisons: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, eq_ignore_caseCase conversion: to_lowercase / to_uppercaseString checks: starts_with / ends_with / containsTrimming: trim_start / trim_end / trimPrefix/suffix operations: strip_prefix / strip_suffixSearch: find / rfindWhen encrypting strings, you can add padding to hide the actual length of strings. The null character (b'\0') is used as the padding. Here is an example:

# Parameters | TFHE-rs

Parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore workflowParametersThis document explains how the choice of cryptographic parameters impacts both the security and efficiency of FHE algorithms. The chosen parameters determine the error probability (sometimes referred to failure probability) and overall performance of computations using fully homomorphic encryption. This error probability is due to the noisy nature of FHE computations (see here for more details about the encryption process).All parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator.Default parametersCurrently, the default parameters use blocks that contain 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry - a tweaked uniform (TUniform, defined here) noise distribution, and have a bootstrapping failure probability perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128. These are particularly suitable for applications that need to be secure in the IND-CPA^D model (see here for more details). The GPU backend still uses an error probability smaller than 2−642^{-64}2−64 by default. Those will be updated soon.When using the high-level API of TFHE-rs, you can create a key pair using the default recommended set of parameters. For example: tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations
}These default parameters may be updated with in future releases of TFHE-rs, potentially causing incompatibilities between versions. For production systems, it is therefore recommended to specify a fixed parameter set.Parameters versioning and naming schemeParameter sets are versioned for backward compatibility. This means that each set of parameters can be tied to a specific version of TFHE-rs, so that they remain unchanged and compatible after an upgrade.All parameter sets are stored as variables inside the tfhe::shortint::parameters module, with submodules named after the versions of TFHE-rs in which these parameters where added. For example, parameters added in TFHE-rs v1.0 can be found inside tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_0.The naming convention of these parameters indicates their capabilities. Taking tfhe::parameters::v1_0::V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128 as an example:V1_0: these parameters were introduced in TFHE-rs v1.0MESSAGE_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of messageCARRY_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of carryKS_PBS: the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrapTUNIFORM: the tweaked uniform noise distribution is used2M128: the probability of failure for the bootstrap is 2−1282^{-128}2−128For convenience, aliases are provided for the most used sets of parameters and stored in the module tfhe::shortint::parameters::aliases. Note, however, that these parameters are not stable over time and are always updated to the latest TFHE-rs version. For this reason, they should only be used for prototyping and are not suitable for production use cases.How to choose the parameter setsYou can override the default parameters with the with_custom_parameters(block_parameters) method of the Config object. For example, to use a Gaussian distribution instead of the TUniform one, you can modify your configuration as follows:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_0::V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
fn main() {
let config =
ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128)
.build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations

# Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rs

Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingCompressing ciphertexts/keysThis document explains the mechanism and steps to compress ciphertext and keys to reduce the storage needed as well as transmission times.Most TFHE-rs entities contain random numbers generated by a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). Since the implemented PRNG is deterministic, storing only the random seed used to generate those numbers preserves all necessary information. When decompressing the entity, using the same PRNG and the same seed will reconstruct the full chain of random values.In TFHE-rs, compressible entities are prefixed with Compressed. For instance, a compressed FheUint256 is declared as CompressedFheUint256.In the following example code, we use the bincode crate dependency to serialize in a binary format and compare serialized sizes.Compressing CiphertextsCompressing ciphertexts at encryption timeThis example shows how to compress a ciphertext encrypting messages over 16 bits: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, CompressedFheUint16};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let clear = 12_837u16;
let compressed = CompressedFheUint16::try_encrypt(clear, &client_key).unwrap();
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed).unwrap().len()
);
let decompressed = compressed.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&decompressed).unwrap().len()
);
let clear_decompressed: u16 = decompressed.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear_decompressed, clear);
}Compression ciphertexts after some homomorphic computationYou can compress ciphertexts at any time, even after performing multiple homomorphic operations.To do so, you need to build a list containing all the ciphertexts that have to be compressed. This list might contain ciphertexts of different types, e.g., FheBool, FheUint32, FheInt64,... There is no constraint regarding the size of the list.There are two possible approaches:Single list: Compressing several ciphertexts into a single list. This generally yields a better compression ratio between output and input sizes;Multiple lists: Using multiple lists. This offers more flexibility, since compression might happen at different times in the code, but could lead to larger outputs.In more details, the optimal ratio is achieved with a list whose size is equal to the lwe_per_glwe field from the CompressionParameters.The following example shows how to compress and decompress a list containing 4 messages: one 32-bits integer, one 64-bit integer, one boolean, and one 2-bit integer.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2,

let c = a + 234u8;
let decrypted: u8 = c.decrypt(&cks);

}
Compressed public keysThis example shows how to compress the classical public keys:It is not currently recommended to use the CompressedPublicKey to encrypt ciphertexts without first decompressing them. If the resulting PublicKey is too large to fit in memory, it may result in significant slowdowns.This issue has been identified and will be addressed in future releases.use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, CompressedPublicKey};

let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let compressed_public_key = CompressedPublicKey::new(&client_key);
println!("compressed size : {}", bincode::serialize(&compressed_public_key).unwrap().len());
let public_key = compressed_public_key.decompress();
println!("decompressed size: {}", bincode::serialize(&public_key).unwrap().len());
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(213u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear, 213u8);
}Compressed compact public keyThis example shows how to use compressed compact public keys:use tfhe::{

Data versioning | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingData versioningData versioning and backward compatibilityThis document explains how to save and load versioned data using the data versioning feature.Starting from v0.6.4, TFHE-rs supports versioned data types. This allows you to store data and load it in the future without compatibility concerns. This feature is done by the tfhe-versionable crate.This versioning scheme is compatible with all the data formats supported by serde.Saving and loading versioned dataTo use the versioning feature, wrap your types in their versioned equivalents before serialization using the versionize method. You can load serialized data with the unversionize function, even in newer versions of TFHE-rs where the data types might evolve. The unversionize function manages any necessary data type upgrades, ensuring compatibility.

let output: u8 = loaded_ct.decrypt(&loaded_client_key);
assert_eq!(msg, output);
}VersionizeCalling .versionize() on a value will add versioning tags. This is done recursively so all the subtypes that compose it are versioned too. Under the hood, it converts the value into an enum where each version of a type is represented by a new variant. The returned object can be serialized using serde: bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &versioned_client_key).unwrap();UnversionizeThe Type::unversionize() function takes a versioned value, upgrades it to the latest version of its type and removes the version tags. To do that, it matches the version in the versioned enum and eventually apply a conversion function that upgrades it to the most recent version. The resulting value can then be used inside TFHE-rs let loaded_client_key =
ClientKey::unversionize(versioned_client_key).unwrap();Breaking changesWhen possible, data will be upgraded automatically without any kind of interraction. However, some changes might need information that are only known by the user of the library. These are called data breaking changes. In these occasions, TFHE-rs provides a way to upgrade these types manually.You will find below a list of breaking changes and how to upgrade them.PreviousSerialization/deserializationNextAdvanced featuresLast updated 7 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs

*Source: tfhe-rs/1.0/fhe-computation/data-handling/serialization.html*

Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingSerialization/deserializationThis document explains the serialization and deserialization features that are useful to send data to a server to perform the computations.Safe serialization/deserializationWhen dealing with sensitive types, it's important to implement safe serialization and safe deserialization functions to prevent runtime errors and enhance security. TFHE-rs provide easy to use functions for this purpose, such as safe_serialize, safe_deserialize and safe_deserialize_conformant.Here is a basic example on how to use it:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, safe_serialize};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
// The last argument is the max allowed size for the serialized buffer
safe_serialize(&server_key, &mut buffer, 1 << 30).unwrap();
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}The safe deserialization must take the output of a safe-serialization as input. During the process, the following validation occurs:Type match: deserializing type A from a serialized type B raises an error indicating "On deserialization, expected type A, got type B".Version compatibility: data serialized in previous versions of TFHE-rs are automatically upgraded to the latest version using the data versioning feature.Parameter compatibility: deserializing an object of type A with one set of crypto parameters from an object of type A with another set of crypto parameters raises an error indicating "Deserialized object of type A not conformant with given parameter set"If both parameter sets have the same LWE dimension for ciphertexts, a ciphertext from param 1 may not fail this deserialization check with param 2.This check can't distinguish ciphertexts/server keys from independent client keys with the same parameters.This check is meant to prevent runtime errors in server homomorphic operations by checking that server keys and ciphertexts are compatible with the same parameter set.You can use the standalone is_conformant method to check parameter compatibility. Besides, the safe_deserialize_conformant function includes the parameter compatibility check, and the safe_deserialize function does not include the compatibility check.Size limit: both serialization and deserialization processes expect a size limit (measured in bytes) for the serialized data:On serialization, an error is raised if the serialized output exceeds the specific limit.On deserialization, an error is raised if the serialized input exceeds the specific limit.This feature aims to gracefully return an error in case of an attacker trying to cause an out-of-memory error on deserialization.Here is a more complete example:
use tfhe::conformance::ParameterSetConformant;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_serialize, safe_deserialize_conformant};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128};
use tfhe::conformance::ListSizeConstraint;
use tfhe::{
generate_keys, FheUint8, CompactCiphertextList, FheUint8ConformanceParams,
CompactPublicKey, ConfigBuilder, CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams
};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
let params_2 = PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
assert_ne!(params_1, params_2);
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let conformance_params_1 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_1);
let conformance_params_2 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_2);
let public_key = CompactPublicKey::new(&client_key);
let msg = 27u8;
let ct = FheUint8::try_encrypt(msg, &client_key).unwrap();
assert!(ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_1));
assert!(!ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_2));
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&ct, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
assert!(safe_deserialize_conformant::<FheUint8>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_2)
.is_err());
let ct2: FheUint8 = safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_1)
.unwrap();
let dec: u8 = ct2.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(msg, dec);
// Example with a compact list:
let msgs = [27, 188u8];
let mut builder = CompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key);
builder.extend(msgs.iter().copied());
let compact_list = builder.build();
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&compact_list, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
let conformance_params = CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams {
shortint_params: params_1.to_shortint_conformance_param(),
num_elements_constraint: ListSizeConstraint::exact_size(2),
};
safe_deserialize_conformant::<CompactCiphertextList>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params)
.unwrap();
}The safe serialization and deserialization use bincode internally.To selectively disable some of the features of the safe serialization, you can use SerializationConfig/DeserializationConfig builders. For example, it is possible to disable the data versioning:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, SerializationConfig};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
SerializationConfig::new(1 << 30).disable_versioning().serialize_into(&server_key, &mut buffer).unwrap();
// You will still be able to load this item with `safe_deserialize_conformant`, but only using the current version of TFHE-rs
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}Serialization/deserialization using serdeTFHE-rs uses the Serde framework and implements Serde's Serialize and Deserialize traits.This allows you to serialize into any data format supported by serde. However, this is a more bare bone approach as none of the checks described in the previous section will be performed for you.In the following example, we use bincode for its binary format:
[dependencies]
# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs
tfhe = { version = "~1.0.1", features = ["integer"] }
bincode = "1.3.3"
use std::io::Cursor;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, ServerKey, generate_keys, set_server_key, FheUint8};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>{
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
let value_1 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg1, &client_key);
let value_2 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg2, &client_key);
// Prepare to send data to the server
// The ClientKey is _not_ sent
let mut serialized_data = Vec::new();
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &server_key)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_1)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_2)?;
// Simulate sending serialized data to a server and getting
// back the serialized result
let serialized_result = server_function(&serialized_data)?;
let result: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize(&serialized_result)?;
let output: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(output, msg1 + msg2);
Ok(())
}
fn server_function(serialized_data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut serialized_data = Cursor::new(serialized_data);
let server_key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize_from(&mut serialized_data)?;
let ct_1: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize_from(&mut serialized_data)?;
let ct_2: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize_from(&mut serialized_data)?;

# Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rs

Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresEncrypted pseudo random valuesThis document explains the mechanism and steps to generate an oblivious encrypted random value using only server keys.The goal is to give to the server the possibility to generate a random value, which will be obtained in an encrypted format and will remain unknown to the server. The implementation is based on this article.This is possible through two methods on FheUint and FheInt:generate_oblivious_pseudo_random which return an integer taken uniformly in the full integer range ([0; 2^N[ for a FheUintN and [-2^(N-1); 2^(N-1)[ for a FheIntN).generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded which return an integer taken uniformly in [0; 2^random_bits_count[. For a FheUintN, we must have random_bits_count <= N. For a FheIntN, we must have random_bits_count <= N - 1.Both methods functions take a seed Seed as input, which could be any u128 value. They both rely on the use of the usual server key. The output is reproducible, i.e., the function is deterministic from the inputs: assuming the same hardware, seed and server key, this function outputs the same random encrypted value.Here is an example of the usage: tfhe::prelude::FheDecrypt;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8, FheInt8, Seed};
pub fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let random_bits_count = 3;
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(dec_result < (1 << random_bits_count));
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);

# Overflow detection | TFHE-rs

Overflow detection | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresOverflow detectionThis document explains how TFHE-rs implements specific operations to detect overflows in computations.The mechanism of detecting overflow consists in returning an encrypted flag with a specific ciphertext that reflects the state of the computation. When an overflow occurs, this flag is set to true. Since the server is not able to evaluate this encrypted value, the client has to check the flag value when decrypting to determine if an overflow has happened.These operations might be slower than their non-overflow-detecting equivalent, so they are not enabled by default. To use them, you must explicitly call specific operators. At the moment, only additions, subtractions, and multiplications are supported. We plan to add more operations in future releases.Here's the list of operations supported along with their symbol:Addoverflow_addBinarySuboverflow_subBinaryMuloverflow_mulBinaryThe usage of these operations is similar to the standard ones. The key difference is in the decryption process, as shown in following example:
//
// * The operation is modular, i.e on overflow the result wraps around.
// * On overflow the [FheBool] is true, otherwise false
use tfhe::prelude::*;

# Public key encryption | TFHE-rs

Public key encryption | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresPublic key encryptionThis document explains public key encryption and provides instructions for 2 methods.Public key encryption refers to the cryptographic paradigm where the encryption key can be publicly distributed, whereas the decryption key remains secret to the owner. This differs from the usual case where the same secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. In TFHE-rs, there are two methods for public key encryptions:Classical public key: the first method involves the public key containing many encryptions of zero, as detailed in Guide to Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the [Discretized] Torus, Appendix A.Compact public key: the second method is based on the paper TFHE Public-Key Encryption Revisited, allowing for significantly smaller key sizes compared to the first method.Public keys can also be compressed to reduce size.Classical public keyThis example shows how to use classical public keys. tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, PublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);

let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);

}Compact public keyThis example shows how to use compact public keys. The main difference is in the ConfigBuilder where the parameter set has been changed.For more information on using compact public keys to encrypt data and generate a zero-knowledge proof of correct encryption at the same time, see the guide on ZK proofs.use tfhe::{

# Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rs

Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresMulti-threading with Rayon crateThis document describes how to use Rayon for parallel processing in TFHE-rs, detailing configurations for single and multi-client applications with code examples.Rayon is a popular Rust crate that simplifies writing multi-threaded code. You can use Rayon to write multi-threaded TFHE-rs code. However, due to the specifications of Rayon and TFHE-rs, certain setups are necessary.Single-client applicationThe problemThe high-level API requires to call set_server_key on each thread where computations need to be done. So a first attempt to use Rayon with TFHE-rs might look like this: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
// set_server_key in each closure as they might be
// running in different threads
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
}However, due to Rayon's work-stealing mechanism and TFHE-rs' internals, this may create BorrowMutError.Working exampleThe correct way is to call rayon::broadcast as follows:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
// set the server key in all of the rayon's threads so that
// we won't need to do it later
rayon::broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks.clone()));
// Set the server key in the main thread
set_server_key(sks);
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
let a: u8 = a.decrypt(&cks);
let b: u8 = b.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(a, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b, 6u8);
}Multi-client applicationsFor applications that need to operate concurrently on data from different clients and require each client to use multiple threads, you need to create separate Rayon thread pools:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks1, sks1) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks1),
];
let ys1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks1),
];
let (cks2, sks2) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(100u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(200u8, &cks2),
];

# Trivial ciphertexts | TFHE-rs

Trivial ciphertexts | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresTrivial ciphertextsThis document describes how to use trivial encryption in TFHE-rs to initialize server-side values.Sometimes, the server side needs to initialize a value. For example, when computing the sum of a list of ciphertexts, you typically initialize the sum variable to 0.Instead of asking the client to send an actual encrypted zero, the server can use a trivial encryption. A trivial encryption creates a ciphertext that contains the desired value but isn't securely encrypted - essentially anyone, any key can decrypt it. tfhe::prelude::*;

# Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rs

Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresZero-knowledge proofsThis document explains how to implement the zero-knowledge proofs function for compact public key encryption to verify the encryption process without revealing the encrypted information.TFHE-rs can generate zero-knowledge proofs to verify that the compact public key encryption process is correct. In other words, TFHE-rs generates the proof without revealing any information other than the already known range of the encrypted message. This technique is derived from Libert’s work.You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=zk-pok when building TFHE-rs.To use this feature, you must first generate a CRS (Common Reference String). The CRS is a piece of cryptographic data that is necessary to ensure the security of zero-knowledge proofs. The CRS should be generated in advance and shared between all the clients and the server. A CRS can be reused for multiple encryptions with the same parameters.Once the CRS is generated, using zero-knowledge proofs is straightforward: during encryption, the client generates the proof, and the server validates it before performing any homomorphic computations.Note that you need to use dedicated parameters for the compact public key encryption. This helps to reduce the size of encrypted data and speed up the zero-knowledge proof computation.The following example shows how a client can encrypt and prove a ciphertext, and how a server can verify and compute the ciphertext: rand::prelude::*;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};
pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Indicate which parameters to use for the Compact Public Key encryption
let cpk_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_PKE_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// And parameters allowing to keyswitch/cast to the computation parameters.
let casting_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_KEYSWITCH_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Enable the dedicated parameters on the config
let config = tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params)
.use_dedicated_compact_public_key_parameters((cpk_params, casting_params)).build();
// The CRS should be generated in an offline phase then shared to all clients and the server
let crs = CompactPkeCrs::from_config(config, 64).unwrap();
// Then use TFHE-rs as usual
let client_key = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let server_key = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&client_key);
let public_key = tfhe::CompactPublicKey::try_new(&client_key).unwrap();
// This can be left empty, but if provided allows to tie the proof to arbitrary data
let metadata = [b'T', b'F', b'H', b'E', b'-', b'r', b's'];
let clear_a = rng.gen::<u64>();
let clear_b = rng.gen::<u64>();
let proven_compact_list = tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(clear_a)
.push(clear_b)
.build_with_proof_packed(&crs, &metadata, ZkComputeLoad::Verify)?;
// Server side
let result = {
set_server_key(server_key);
// Verify the ciphertexts
let expander =
proven_compact_list.verify_and_expand(&crs, &public_key, &metadata)?;
let a: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(0)?.unwrap();
let b: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(1)?.unwrap();
a + b
};
// Back on the client side
let a_plus_b: u64 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(a_plus_b, clear_a.wrapping_add(clear_b));
Ok(())
}Performance can be improved by setting lto="fat" in Cargo.tomllto = "fat"and by building the code for the native CPU architecture and in release mode, e.g. by calling RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release.You can choose a more costly proof with ZkComputeLoad::Proof, which has a faster verification time. Alternatively, you can select ZkComputeLoad::Verify for a faster proof and slower verification.Scheme versionThe ZK scheme used to generate and verify proofs is available in two versions:ZKV1: This version is close to the original paper from Libert.ZKV2: Differing from the paper, this version provides better performance for provers and verifiers.TFHE-rs selects automatically the scheme to use based on the encryption parameters during the CRS generation. With default parameters, ZKV2 is selected.The following example shows how to generate a CRS and proofs for ZKV1. Compared to the previous example, only the parameters are changed:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};

# Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringThis tutorial demonstrates how to build your own data type that represents an ASCII string in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) by implementing to_lower and to_upper functions.Since version 0.11, TFHE-rs has introduced the strings feature, which provides an easy to use FHE strings API. See the fhe strings guide for more information.An ASCII character is stored in 7 bits. In this tutorial, we use the FheUint8 to store an encrypted ASCII:The uppercase letters are in the range [65, 90]The lowercase letters are in the range [97, 122]The relationship between uppercase and lowercase letters is defined as follows:lower_case = upper_case + UP_LOW_DISTANCEupper_case = lower_case - UP_LOW_DISTANCEWhere UP_LOW_DISTANCE = 32Types and methodsThis type stores the encrypted characters as a Vec<FheUint8> to implement case conversion functions.To use the FheUint8 type, enable the integer feature:
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.0.1", features = ["integer"] }The MyFheString::encrypt function performs data validation to ensure the input string contains only ASCII characters.In FHE operations, direct branching on encrypted values is not possible. However, you can evaluate a boolean condition to obtain the desired outcome. Here is an example to check and convert the 'char' to a lowercase without using a branch:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
if c > 64 && c < 91 {
c + UP_LOW_DISTANCE
} else {
c
}
}You can remove the branch this way:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
c + ((c > 64) as u8 & (c < 91) as u8) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}This method can adapt to operations on homomorphic integers:
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::FheUint8;
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}Full example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ClientKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8};
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
struct MyFheString {
bytes: Vec<FheUint8>,
}
fn to_upper(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c - FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(96) & c.lt(123)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
impl MyFheString {
fn encrypt(string: &str, client_key: &ClientKey) -> Self {
assert!(
string.is_ascii(),
"The input string must only contain ascii letters"
);
let fhe_bytes: Vec<FheUint8> = string
.bytes()
.map(|b| FheUint8::encrypt(b, client_key))
.collect();
Self { bytes: fhe_bytes }
}
fn decrypt(&self, client_key: &ClientKey) -> String {
let ascii_bytes: Vec<u8> = self
.bytes
.iter()
.map(|fhe_b| fhe_b.decrypt(client_key))
.collect();
String::from_utf8(ascii_bytes).unwrap()
}
fn to_upper(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_upper).collect(),
}
}
fn to_lower(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_lower).collect(),
}
}
}
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string = MyFheString::encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key);
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_upper();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lower();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");
}Using TFHE-rs strings featureThis code can be greatly simplified by using the strings feature from TFHE-rs.First, add the feature in your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.0.1", features = ["strings"] }The FheAsciiString type allows to simply do homomorphic case changing of encrypted strings (and much more!):use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheAsciiString};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string =
FheAsciiString::try_encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key).unwrap();
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_uppercase();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lowercase();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");

# SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rs

SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSHA256 with Boolean APIThis tutorial guides you to convert a regular SHA-256 function to its homomorphic version, with considerations of optimal performances. You will learn:The basics of the SHA-256 function.The steps to implement SHA-256 homomorphically.SHA-256 basicsFirst, you need to implement the SHA-256 function. You can find the official specification for SHA-256 here. We summarize the three key aspects of SHA-256 outlined in the document:PaddingThe SHA-256 function processes the input data in blocks or chunks of 512 bits. Before performing the hash computations, prepare the data as follows:Append a single "1" bitAppend "0" bits until exactly 64 bits remain to make the message length a multiple of 512Append the last 64 bits as a binary encoding of the original input lengthIn this diagram, the numbers on the top represent the length of the padded input at each position. The formula L+1+k+64 ensures that the length reaches a multiple of 512, matching the required length of the padded input.Operations and functionsWe will use bitwise AND, XOR, NOT, addition modulo 2^32, the Rotate Right (ROTR) and Shift Right (SHR) operations as building blocks for functions inside the SHA-256 computation. These operations all use 32-bit words and produce new words.We combine these operations inside the sigma (with 4 variations), Ch, and Maj functions. When changing SHA-256 to the homomorphic computation, we will mainly change the code of each operation.Here is the definition of each function:Maj(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) XOR (y AND z)
Σ0(x) = ROTR-2(x) XOR ROTR-13(x) XOR ROTR-22(x)
Σ1(x) = ROTR-6(x) XOR ROTR-11(x) XOR ROTR-25(x)
σ0(x) = ROTR-7(x) XOR ROTR-18(x) XOR SHR-3(x)
σ1(x) = ROTR-17(x) XOR ROTR-19(x) XOR SHR-10(x)We simplify Maj using the Boolean distributive law: (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) = x AND (y XOR z), as shown below:We simplify Ch using a single bitwise multiplexer. Here's the truth table of the Ch expression.00000011010001111000101011011111This table shows that the result equals to z when x = 0, and the result equals to y when x = 1, which means if x {y} else {z}. Hence we can replace the 4 bitwise operations of Ch by a single bitwise multiplexer.All these operations can be evaluated homomorphically:ROTR and SHR: They can be evaluated by changing the index of each ecrypted bit of the word without using any homomorphic operation.Bitwise AND, XOR and multiplexer: They can be computed homomorphicallyAddition modulo 2^32: It can be broken down into boolean homomorphic operations.SHA-256 computationThe SHA-256 function processes data in 512-bit chunks. Here is what happens during computation:The 512-bit chunk is computed into 16 words, each containing 32 bits.Another 48 words are computed using the previous function.After computing the 64 words, within the same chunk, a compression loop will compute a hash value (8 32-bit words) using the previous functions and some constants to mix everything up.This entire process iterate through each 512-bit chunk of your data.When we finish the last chunk iteration, the resulting hash values will be the output of the SHA-256 function.Here is an example of this function using arrays of 32 bools to represent words:
// Initialize hash values with constant values
let mut hash: [[bool; 32]; 8] = [
hex_to_bools(0x6a09e667), hex_to_bools(0xbb67ae85),
hex_to_bools(0x3c6ef372), hex_to_bools(0xa54ff53a),
hex_to_bools(0x510e527f), hex_to_bools(0x9b05688c),
hex_to_bools(0x1f83d9ab), hex_to_bools(0x5be0cd19),
];
let chunks = padded_input.chunks(512);
for chunk in chunks {
let mut w = [[false; 32]; 64];
// Copy first 16 words from current chunk
for i in 0..16 {
w[i].copy_from_slice(&chunk[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32]);
}
// Compute the other 48 words
for i in 16..64 {
w[i] = add(add(add(sigma1(&w[i - 2]), w[i - 7]), sigma0(&w[i - 15])), w[i - 16]);
}
let mut a = hash[0];
let mut b = hash[1];
let mut c = hash[2];
let mut d = hash[3];
let mut e = hash[4];
let mut f = hash[5];
let mut g = hash[6];
let mut h = hash[7];
// Compression loop, each iteration uses a specific constant from K
for i in 0..64 {
let temp1 = add(add(add(add(h, ch(&e, &f, &g)), w[i]), hex_to_bools(K[i])), sigma_upper_case_1(&e));
let temp2 = add(sigma_upper_case_0(&a), maj(&a, &b, &c));
h = g;
g = f;
f = e;
e = add(d, temp1);
d = c;
c = b;
b = a;
a = add(temp1, temp2);
}
hash[0] = add(hash[0], a);
hash[1] = add(hash[1], b);
hash[2] = add(hash[2], c);
hash[3] = add(hash[3], d);
hash[4] = add(hash[4], e);
hash[5] = add(hash[5], f);
hash[6] = add(hash[6], g);
hash[7] = add(hash[7], h);
}
// Concatenate the final hash values to produce a 256-bit hash
let mut output = [false; 256];
for i in 0..8 {
output[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32].copy_from_slice(&hash[i]);
}
output
}Homomorphic SHA-256 on encrypted dataTo convert SHA-256 to a homomorphic version, you can replace each bit of padded_input with a fully homomorphic encryption of the same bit value and operate on the encrypted value using homomorphic operations.While the structure of the SHA-256 function remains the same, there are some important considerations in the code:The function signature and the borrowing rules should adapt to the ciphertext type (representing the encrypted bits).Implementing SHA-256 operations with homomorphic encryption uses homomorphic boolean operations internally.Homomorphic operations on encrypted data can be very expensive. Consider these options for better speed:Remove unnecessary use of homomorphic operations and maximize parallelization.Simplify the code with Rayon crate that parallelizes iterators and manages threads efficiently.The final code is available here.Now let's dive into details of each SHA256 operation.Rotate Right and Shift RightRotate Right and Shift Right can be evaluated by changing the position of each encrypted bit in the word, requiring no homomorphic operations. Here is the implementation: let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result
}
fn shift_right(x: &[Ciphertext; 32], n: usize, sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result[..n].fill_with(|| sk.trivial_encrypt(false));
result
}Bitwise XOR, AND, MultiplexerTo implement these operations, we will use the xor, and mux methods from the TFHE-rs library to perform each boolean operation homomorphically.For better efficiency, we can parallelize the homomorphic computations because we operate bitwise. It means that we can homomorphically XOR the bits at index 0 of two words using one thread while XORing the bits at index 1 using another thread, and so on. This approach allows for the computation of bitwise operations using up to 32 concurrent threads, corresponding to the 32-bit words used.Here is the implementation of the bitwise homomorphic XOR operation. The par_iter and par_iter_mut methods create a parallel iterator that we use to compute each XOR efficiently. The other two bitwise operations are implemented in the same way. let mut result = a.clone();
result.par_iter_mut()
.zip(a.par_iter().zip(b.par_iter()))
.for_each(|(dst, (lhs, rhs))| *dst = sk.xor(lhs, rhs));
result
}Addition modulo 2^32This might be the trickiest operation to efficiently implement in a homomorphic manner. A naive implementation could use the Ripple Carry Adder algorithm, which is straightforward but cannot be parallelized because each step depends on the previous one.A better choice is to use Carry Lookahead Adder, which allows us to use the parallelized AND and XOR bitwise operations. With this design, our adder is around 50% faster than the Ripple Carry Adder. let propagate = xor(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
let generate = and(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise AND
let carry = compute_carry(&propagate, &generate, sk);
let sum = xor(&propagate, &carry, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
sum
}

}

}To further optimize performance, we use parallel prefix algorithms to parallelize the function that computes the carry signals. These algorithms involve more (homomorphic) boolean operations and their parallel nature speeds up the processing. We have implemented the Brent-Kung and Ladner-Fischer algorithms with different tradeoffs:Brent-Kung has the least amount of boolean operations we could find (140 when using grey cells, for 32-bit numbers), which makes it suitable when we can't process many operations concurrently and fast. Our results confirm that it's indeed faster than both the sequential algorithm and Ladner-Fischer when run on regular computers.On the other hand, Ladner-Fischer performs more boolean operations (209 using grey cells) than Brent-Kung, but they are performed in larger batches. Hence we can compute more operations in parallel and finish earlier, but we need more fast threads available or they will slow down the carry signals computation. Ladner-Fischer can be suitable when using cloud-based computing services, which offer many high-speed threads.Our implementation uses Brent-Kung by default, but you can enable Ladner-Fischer by using the --ladner-fischer command line argument.For more information about parallel prefix adders, you can read this paper or this other paper.Finally, with all these SHA-256 operations working homomorphically, our functions will be homomomorphic as well along with the whole SHA-256 function (after adapting the code to work with the Ciphertext type).More parallel processingLet's talk about other performance improvements we can make before we finish.In the main sha256_fhe, you can perform some functions in parallel. For example, in the compression loop, temp1 and temp2 can be computed in parallel by using the rayon::join() function when there is a CPU available. The two temporary values in the compression loop are the result of multiple additions, so you can use nested calls to rayon::join() to parallelize more operations.Another way to speed up consecutive additions would be using the Carry Save Adder, a very efficient adder that takes 3 numbers and returns a sum and a carry sequence. If our inputs are A, B, and C, we can construct a CSA with our previously implemented Maj function and the bitwise XOR operation as follows:Sum = A XOR B XOR CBy chaining CSAs, we can input the sum and carry from a preceding stage along with another number into a new CSA. Finally, to get the result of the additions we add the sum and carry sequences using a conventional adder. In the end, we are performing the same number of additions, but some of them are now CSAs, speeding up the process. Below is the illustration of this process in the temp1 and temp2 computations. || {
let ((sum, carry), s1) = rayon::join(
|| {
let ((sum, carry), ch) = rayon::join(
|| csa(&h, &w[i], &trivial_bools(&hex_to_bools(K[i]), sk), sk),
|| ch(&e, &f, &g, sk),
);
csa(&sum, &carry, &ch, sk)
},
|| sigma_upper_case_1(&e, sk)
);
let (sum, carry) = csa(&sum, &carry, &s1, sk);
add(&sum, &carry, sk)
},
|| {
add(&sigma_upper_case_0(&a, sk), &maj(&a, &b, &c, sk), sk)
},
);The first closure of the outer call to join will return temp1 and the second temp2.Inside the first outer closure, we call join recursively until we add the value h, the current word w[i], and the current constant K[i] by using the CSA, while potentially computing the ch function in parallel. Then we take the sum, carry, and ch values and add them again using the CSA.All this is done while potentially computing the sigma_upper_case_1 function. Finally we input the previous sum, carry, and sigma values to the CSA and perform the final addition with add. Once again, this is done while potentially computing sigma_upper_case_0 and maj and adding them to get temp2, in the second outer closure.With these types of changes, we finally get a homomorphic SHA256 function that doesn't leave unused computational resources.How to use SHA256_boolFirst, use the --release flag when running the program. Considering the implementation of encrypt_bools and decrypt_bools, the use of SHA-256 will be as follows: let matches = Command::new("Homomorphic sha256")
.arg(Arg::new("ladner_fischer")
.long("ladner-fischer")
.help("Use the Ladner Fischer parallel prefix algorithm for additions")
.action(ArgAction::SetTrue))
.get_matches();
// If set using the command line flag "--ladner-fischer" this algorithm will be used in additions
let ladner_fischer: bool = matches.get_flag("ladner_fischer");
// INTRODUCE INPUT FROM STDIN
let mut input = String::new();
println!("Write input to hash:");
io::stdin()
.read_line(&mut input)
.expect("Failed to read line");
input = input.trim_end_matches('\n').to_string();
println!("You entered: \"{}\"", input);
// CLIENT PADS DATA AND ENCRYPTS IT
let (ck, sk) = gen_keys();
let padded_input = pad_sha256_input(&input);
let encrypted_input = encrypt_bools(&padded_input, &ck);
// SERVER COMPUTES OVER THE ENCRYPTED PADDED DATA
println!("Computing the hash");
let encrypted_output = sha256_fhe(encrypted_input, ladner_fischer, &sk);
// CLIENT DECRYPTS THE OUTPUT
let output = decrypt_bools(&encrypted_output, &ck);
let outhex = bools_to_hex(output);
println!("{}", outhex);
}We can supply the data to hash using a file instead of the command line by using stdin . For example, if the file input.txt is in the same directory as the project, we can use the following shell command after building with cargo build --release:The program accepts hexadecimal inputs. The input must start with "0x" and contain only valid hex digits, otherwise it will be interpreted as text.Finally， padding is performed on the client side. This has the advantage of hiding the exact length of the input content from the server, thus avoiding the server extracting information from the length, even though the content is fully encrypted.It is also feasible to perform padding on the server side. The padding function would take the encrypted input and pad it with trivial bit encryptions. We can then integrate the padding function into the sha256_fhe function computed by the server.PreviousHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringNextAll tutorialsLast updated 7 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Security and cryptography | TFHE-rs

Security and cryptography | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSecurity and cryptographyThis document introduces the cryptographic concepts of the scheme of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) and the security considerations of TFHE-rs.TFHETFHE-rs is a cryptographic library that implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the TFHE scheme. You should understand the basics of TFHE to consider its limitations, such as:The precision: TFHE has limitations on the number of bits used to represent plaintext values.The execution time: TFHE operations are slower than native operations due to their complexity.LWE ciphertextsTFHE-rs primarily utilizes Learning With Errors (LWE) ciphertexts. The LWE problem forms the basis of TFHE's security and is considered resistant to quantum attacks.An LWE Ciphertext is a collection of 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integers. Before encrypting a message in an LWE ciphertext, you first need to encode it as a plaintext by shifting the message to the most significant bits of the unsigned integer type used.Then, you add a small random value called noise to the least significant bits. This noise is crucial in ensuring the security of the ciphertext.plaintext=(Δ∗m)+eplaintext = (\Delta * m) + eplaintext=(Δ∗m)+em∈Zpm \in \mathbb{Z}_pm∈Zp​To get a ciphertext from a plaintext, you must encrypt the plaintext using a secret key.An LWE secret key is a list of n random integers: S=(s0,...,sn−1)S = (s_0, ..., s_{n-1})S=(s0​,...,sn−1​). nnn is called the LweDimensionLweDimensionLweDimensionAn LWE ciphertext is composed of two parts:The mask (a0,...,an−1)(a_0, ..., a_{n-1})(a0​,...,an−1​)The body bbbThe mask of a fresh ciphertext (the result of an encryption, and not the result of operations such as ciphertext addition) is a list of n uniformly random values.The body is computed as follows:b=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintextb = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintextb=(∑i=0n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintextNow that the encryption scheme is defined, let's review the example of the addition between ciphertexts to illustrate why it is slower to compute over encrypted data.To add two ciphertexts, we must add their maskmaskmask and bodybodybody:ct0=(a0,...,an−1,b)ct1=(a0′,...,an−1′,b′)ct2=ct0+ct1ct2=(a0+a0′,...,an−1+an−1′,b+b′)b+b′=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintext+(∑i=0n−1ai′∗si)+plaintext′b+b′=(∑i=0n−1(ai+ai′)∗si)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′ct_0 = (a_{0}, ..., a_{n-1}, b) \\ ct_1 = (a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b^{\prime}) \\ ct_{2} = ct_0 + ct_1 \\ ct_{2} = (a_{0} + a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1} + a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b + b^{\prime})\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintext + (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i^{\prime} * s_i}) + plaintext^{\prime}\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{(a_i + a_i^{\prime})* s_i}) + \Delta m + \Delta m^{\prime} + e + e^{\prime}\\ct0​=(a0​,...,an−1​,b)ct1​=(a0′​,...,an−1′​,b′)ct2​=ct0​+ct1​ct2​=(a0​+a0′​,...,an−1​+an−1′​,b+b′)b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintext+(i=0∑n−1​ai′​∗si​)+plaintext′b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​(ai​+ai′​)∗si​)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′To add ciphertexts, it is necessary to add both their masks and bodies. The operation involves adding n+1n + 1n+1 elements, rather than just adding two integers. This is an intuitive example to show how FHE computation is slower compared to plaintext computation. However, other operations are far more expensive (for example, the computation of a lookup table using Programmable Bootstrapping).Programmable Bootstrapping, noise management, and carry bitsIn FHE, two types of operations can be applied to ciphertexts:Leveled operations, which increase the noise in the ciphertextBootstrapped operations, which reduce the noise in the ciphertextNoise is critical in FHE because it can tamper with the message if not tracked and managed properly. Bootstrapping operations decrease noise within the ciphertexts and guarantee the correctness of computation. The rest of the operations do not need bootstrapping operations, thus they are called leveled operations and are usually very fast as a result.The following sections explain the concept of noise and padding in ciphertexts.NoiseTo ensure security, LWE requires random noise to be added to the message during encryption.TFHE scheme draws this random noise either from:A Centered Normal Distribution with a standard deviation parameter. The choice of standard deviation impacts the security level: increasing the standard deviation enhances security while keeping other factors constant.A Tweaked Uniform (TUniform) Distribution with a bound parameter 2b2^b2b defined as follows: any value in the interval (−2b,...,2b)(−2^b, ... , 2^b)(−2b,...,2b) is selected with probability 1/2b+11/2^{b+1}1/2b+1, with the two end points −2b−2^b−2b and 2b2^b2b being selected with probability 1/2b+21/2^{b+2}1/2b+2. The main advantage of this distribution is to be bounded, whereas the usual Central Normal Distribution one is not. In some practical cases, this can simplify the use of homomorphic computation. The choice of the bound impacts the security level: increasing the bound enhances security while keeping other factors constant.TFHE-rs encodes the noise in the least significant bits of each plaintext. Each leveled computation increases the value of the noise. If too many computations are performed, the noise will eventually overflow into the message bits and lead to an incorrect result.The following figure illustrates how the extra bit of noise is incurred during an addition operation.Noise overtaking the plaintexts after homomorphic addition. Most significant bits are on the left.TFHE-rs enables automatic noise management by performing bootstrapping operations to reset the noise.Programmable BootStrapping (PBS)The bootstrapping of TFHE is programmable. This allows any function to be homomorphically computed over an encrypted input, while also reducing the noise. These functions are represented by look-up tables.In general, the computation of a PBS is preceded or followed by a keyswitch, an operation to change the encryption key. The output ciphertext is then encrypted with the same key as the input one. To do this, two (public) evaluation keys are required: a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key.These operations are quite complex to describe in short, you can find more details about these operations (or about TFHE in general) in the TFHE Deep Dive.CarrySince encoded values have a fixed precision, operating on them can produce results that are outside of the original interval. To avoid losing precision or wrapping around the interval, TFHE-rs uses additional bits by defining bits of padding on the most significant bits.For example, when adding two ciphertexts, the sum could exceed the range of either ciphertext, and thus necessitate a carry that would then be transferred onto the first padding bit. In the following figure, each plaintext over 32 bits has one bit of padding on its left (the most significant bit). After the addition, the padding bit gets consumed to accommodate the carry. We refer to this process as consuming bits of padding. Without any padding-left, further additions may not produce accurate results.SecurityBy default, the cryptographic parameters provided by TFHE-rs ensure at least 128 bits of security. The security has been evaluated using the latest versions of the Lattice Estimator (repository) with red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16.For the High-Level API the default parameters are selected with a bootstrapping failure probability (or error probability) fixed at perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 for the x86 CPU backend, and perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64 for the GPU backend. A failure probability below 2−1282^{-128}2−128 ensures that our implementation is resilient against attacks in the IND-CPA-D model [1]. In the case where only the IND-CPA model is considered, there is a possibility to choose parameters with a perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64, see the dedicated Parameters section[1] Li, Baiyu, et al. "Securing approximate homomorphic encryption using differential privacy." Annual International Cryptology Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022.The parameter sets for the x86 CPU backend with a perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 are obtained using the drift mitigation technique described in [2].[2]Bernard, Olivier, et al. "Drifting Towards Better Error Probabilities in Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes".Classical public key encryption.In classical public key encryption, the public key contains a given number of ciphertexts all encrypting the value 0. By setting the number of encryptions to 0 in the public key at m=⌈(n+1)log⁡(q)⌉+λm = \lceil (n+1) \log(q) \rceil + \lambdam=⌈(n+1)log(q)⌉+λ, where nnn is the LWE dimension, qqq is the ciphertext modulus, and λ\lambdaλ is the number of security bits. This construction is secure due to the leftover hash lemma, which relates to the impossibility of breaking the underlying multiple subset sum problem. This guarantees both a high-density subset sum and an exponentially large number of possible associated random vectors per LWE sample (a,b)(a,b)(a,b).PreviousZero-knowledge proof benchmarksNextTypesLast updated 7 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

However, for other uses, a stable toolchain (version 1.81 or later) is sufficient.Follow the following instructions to install the necessary Rust toolchain:
rustup toolchain install stable
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup toolchain install nightlySetting the toolchainYou can set the toolchain using either of the following methods.Manually specify the toolchain for each cargo command:
cargo +stable build --release
cargo +stable test --release
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo +nightly build --release
cargo +nightly test --releaseOverride the toolchain for the current project:
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup override set stable
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo build --release
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup override set nightly
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo build --releaseTo verify the default toolchain used by Cargo, execute:Choosing your featuresTFHE-rs provides various cargo features to customize the types and features used.Homomorphic typesThis crate provides 3 kinds of data types. Each kind is enabled by activating the corresponding feature in the TOML line and has multiple types:BooleansbooleanBooleansShortIntsshortintShort integersIntegersintegerArbitrary-sized integersAVX-512While the library generally selects automatically the best instruction sets available by the host, in the case of 'AVX-512', you have to choose it explicitly. This requires to use a nightly toolchain with the feature nightly-avx512.PreviousDebuggingNextGPU accelerationLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Contributing | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingThis document provides guidance on how to contribute to TFHE-rs.There are two ways to contribute:Report issues: Open issues on GitHub to report bugs, suggest improvements, or note typos.Submit codes: To become an official contributor, you must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Our CLA-bot will guide you through this process when you open your first pull request.1. Setting up the projectStart by forking the TFHE-rs repository.Rust version: Ensure that you use a Rust version >= 1.81 to compile TFHE-rs.Incompatibility: AArch64-based machines are not yet supported for Windows as it's currently missing an entropy source to be able to seed the CSPRNGs used in TFHE-rs.Performance: For optimal performance, it is highly recommended to run TFHE-rs code in release mode with cargo's --release flag.To get more details about the library, please refer to the documentation.2. Creating a new branchWhen creating your branch, make sure to use the following format :For example:3. Before committing3.1 LintingEach commit to TFHE-rs should conform to the standards of the project. In particular, every source code, docker or workflows files should be linted to prevent programmatic and stylistic errors.Rust source code linters: clippyTypescript/Javascript source code linters: eslint, prettierTo apply automatic code formatting, run:You can perform linting of all Cargo targets with:3.2 TestingYour contributions must include comprehensive documentation and tests without breaking existing tests. To run pre-commit checks, execute:This command ensure that all the targets in the library are building correctly.
For a faster check, use:If you're contributing to GPU code, run also:Unit testing suites are heavy and can require a lot of computing power and RAM availability.
Whilst tests are run automatically in continuous integration pipeline, you can run tests locally.All unit tests have a command formatted as:Run make help to display a list of all the commands available.To quickly test your changes locally, follow these steps:Locate where the code has changed.Add (or modify) a Cargo test filter to the corresponding make target in Makefile.Run the target.make test_<something> will print the underlying cargo command in STDOUT. You can quickly test your changes by copy/pasting the command and then modify it to suit your needs.For example, if you made changes in tfhe/src/integer/*, you can test them with the following steps:In test_integer target, replace the filter -- integer:: by -- my_new_test.Run make test_integer.4. CommittingTFHE-rs follows the conventional commit specification to maintain a consistent commit history, essential for Semantic Versioning (semver.org).
Commit messages are automatically checked in CI and will be rejected if they do not comply, so make sure that you follow the commit conventions detailed on [this page]
(https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).5. RebasingBefore creating a pull request, rebase your branch on the repository's main branch. Merge commits are not permitted, thus rebasing ensures fewer conflicts and a smoother PR review process.6. Opening a Pull RequestOnce your changes are ready, open a pull request.For instructions on creating a PR from a fork, refer to GitHub's official documentation.7. Continuous integrationBefore a pull request can be merged, several test suites run automatically. Below is an overview of the CI process:[!Note]
Useful details:pipeline is triggered by humansreview team is located in Paris timezone, pipeline launch will most likely happen during office hoursdirect changes to CI related files are not allowed for external contributorsrun make pcc to fix any build errors before pushing commits8. Data versioningData serialized with TFHE-rs must remain backward compatible. This is done using the tfhe-versionable crate.If you modify a type that derives Versionize in a backward-incompatible way, an upgrade implementation must be provided.For example, these changes are data breaking:Adding a field to a struct.Changing the order of the fields within a struct or the variants within an enum.Renaming a field of a struct or a variant of an enum.Changing the type of field in a struct or a variant in an enum.On the contrary, these changes are not data breaking:Renaming a type (unless it implements the Named trait).Adding a variant to the end of an enum.Example: adding a fieldSuppose you want to add an i32 field to a type named MyType. The original type is defined as:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
}And you want to change it to:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
other_val: i32
}Follow these steps:Navigate to the definition of the dispatch enum of this type. This is the type inside the #[versionize(MyTypeVersions)] macro attribute. In general, this type has the same name as the base type with a Versions suffix. You should find something likeenum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyType)
}Add a new variant to the enum to preserve the previous version of the type. You can simply copy and paste the previous definition of the type and add a version suffix:struct MyTypeV1 {
val: u64,
}
#[derive(VersionsDispatch)]
enum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyTypeV1),
V2(MyType) // Here this points to your modified type
}Implement the Upgrade trait to define how we should go from the previous version to the current version: type Error = Infallible;
fn upgrade(self) -> Result<MyType, Self::Error> {
Ok(MyType {
val: self.val,
other_val: 0
})
}
}Fix the upgrade target of the previous version. In this example, impl Upgrade<MyType> for MyTypeV0 { should simply be changed to impl Upgrade<MyTypeV1> for MyTypeV0 {PreviousTFHE deep diveLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

What is TFHE-rs? | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageWhat is TFHE-rs?TFHE-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) to perform Boolean and integer arithmetic on encrypted data.TFHE-rs implements advanced TFHE features, empowering developers and researchers with fine-grained control over TFHE so that they can focus on high-level functionality without delving into low-level implementation.TFHE-rs includes:Rust API: the primary API for working with TFHE-rs in Rust projects.C API: for developers who prefer to use C.Client-side WASM API: to integrate TFHE-rs functionalities into WebAssembly applications.Key cryptographic conceptsTFHE is a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme based on Learning With Errors (LWE), which is a secure cryptographic primitive against even quantum computers. The TFHE-rs library implements Zama’s variant of TFHE.Homomorphic Encryption BasicsThe basic elements of cryptography:Message (or Cleartext): raw values before encryption.Plaintext: encoded messages.Ciphertext: encrypted messages.FHE allows to compute on ciphertexts without revealing the content of the messages. A scheme is fully homomorphic if it supports at least two of the following operations when evaluating any programs. (xxx is a plaintext and E[x]E[x]E[x] is the corresponding ciphertext):Homomorphic univariate function evaluation: f(E[x])=E[f(x)]f(E[x]) = E[f(x)]f(E[x])=E[f(x)]Homomorphic addition: E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]E[x] + E[y] = E[x + y]E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]Homomorphic multiplication: E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]E[x] * E[y] = E[x * y]E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]Zama's variant of TFHEZama's variant of TFHE is a fully homomorphic scheme that takes fixed-precision numbers as messages. It implements all homomorphic operations needed, such as addition and function evaluation via Programmable Bootstrapping.Refer to the preliminary whitepaper for more details.Using TFHE-rs in Rust includes the following steps:Key generation: generate a pair of keys using secure parameters.Client key: used for encryption and decryption of data. This key must be kept secret.Server key (or Evaluation key): used for performing operations on encrypted data. This key could be public.Encryption: encrypt plaintexts using the client key to produce ciphertexts.Homomorphic operation: perform operations on ciphertexts using the server key.Decryption: decrypt the resulting ciphertexts back to plaintexts using the client key.To understand more about FHE applications, see the 6-minute introduction to homomorphic encryption.PreviousWelcome to TFHE-rsNextInstallationLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# JS on WASM API | TFHE-rs

JS on WASM API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageJS on WASM APIThis document outlines how to use the TFHE-rs WebAssembly (WASM) client API for key generation, encryption, and decryption, providing setup examples for Node.js and web browsers.TFHE-rs supports WASM client API, which includes functionality for key generation, encryption, and decryption. However, it does not support FHE computations.TFHE-rs supports 3 WASM targets:Node.js: For use in Node.js applications or packagesWeb: For use in web browsersWeb-parallel: For use in web browsers with multi-threading supportThe core of the API remains the same, requiring only minor changes in the initialization functions.Node.jsExample: {
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfheCompactPublicKey,
TfheCompressedServerKey,
TfheConfigBuilder,
CompactCiphertextList
} = require("/path/to/built/pkg/tfhe.js");
const assert = require("node:assert").strict;
function fhe_uint32_example() {
// Makes it so that if a rust thread panics,
// the error message will be displayed in the console
init_panic_hook();
const U32_MAX = 4294967295;
const block_params = new ShortintParameters(ShortintParametersName.V1_1_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_COMPACT_PK_PBS_KS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);
let config = TfheConfigBuilder.default()
.build();
let clientKey = TfheClientKey.generate(config);
let compressedServerKey = TfheCompressedServerKey.new(clientKey);
let publicKey = TfheCompactPublicKey.new(clientKey);
let values = [0, 1, 2394, U32_MAX];
let builder = CompactCiphertextList.builder(publicKey);
for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
builder.push_u32(values[i]);
}
let compact_list = builder.build();
let serialized_list = compact_list.serialize();
let deserialized_list = CompactCiphertextList.deserialize(serialized_list);
let encrypted_list = deserialized_list.expand();
assert.deepStrictEqual(encrypted_list.len(), values.length);
for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++)
{
let decrypted = encrypted_list.get_uint32(i).decrypt(clientKey);
assert.deepStrictEqual(decrypted, values[i]);
}
}
fhe_uint32_example();
WebWhen using the Web WASM target, you should call an additional init function. With parallelism enabled, you need to call another additional initThreadPool function.Example: initThreadPool, // only available with parallelism
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfhePublicKey,
} from "./pkg/tfhe.js";
async function example() {
await init()
await initThreadPool(navigator.hardwareConcurrency);
await init_panic_hook();
const block_params = new ShortintParameters(ShortintParametersName.V1_1_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_COMPACT_PK_PBS_KS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);
// ....
}Compiling the WASM APIUse the provided Makefile in the TFHE-rs repository to compile for the desired target:make build_node_js_api for the Node.js APImake build_web_js_api for the browser APImake build_web_js_api_parallel for the browser API with parallelismThe compiled WASM packages are located in tfhe/pkg.The browser API and the Node.js API are available as npm packages. Using npm i tfhe for the browser API and npm i node-tfhe for the Node.js API.Extra steps for web bundlersWhen using the browser API with parallelism, some extra step might be needed depending on the bundler used:Usage with WebpackIf you're using Webpack v5 (version >= 5.25.1), you don't need to do anything special, as it already supports bundling Workers out of the box.Usage with ParcelParcel v2 also recognises the used syntax and works out of the box.Usage with RollupFor Rollup, you'll need @surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread plugin (version >= 2.1.0) which brings the same functionality and was tested with this crate.Alternatively, you can use Vite which has necessary plugins built-in.(Taken from RReverser/wasm-bindgen-rayon)Using the JS on WASM APITFHE-rs uses WASM to provide a JavaScript (JS) binding to the client-side primitives, like key generation and encryption within the Boolean and shortint modules.Currently, there are several limitations. Due to a lack of threading support in WASM, key generation can be too slow to be practical for bigger parameter sets.Some parameter sets lead to the FHE keys exceeding the 2GB memory limit of WASM, making these parameter sets virtually unusable.First steps using TFHE-rs JS on WASM APISetting up TFHE-rs JS on WASM API for Node.js programs.To build the JS on WASM bindings for TFHE-rs, install wasm-pack and the necessary rust toolchain.

$Commented code to generate keys for shortint and encrypt a ciphertextMake sure to update the path of the required clause in the example below to match the location of the TFHE package that was just built.const assert = require('node:assert').strict;
// Import the Shortint module from the TFHE-rs package generated earlier
const { Shortint, ShortintParametersName, ShortintParameters } = require("/path/to/built/tfhe/pkg");
function shortint_example() {
// Get pre-defined parameters from the shortint module to manage messages with 4 bits of useful
// information in total (2 bits of "message" and 2 bits of "carry")
let params_name = ShortintParametersName.PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
let params = new ShortintParameters(params_name);
// Create a new secret ClientKey, this must not be shared
console.log("Generating client keys...")
let cks = Shortint.new_client_key(params);
// Encrypt 3 in a ciphertext
console.log("Encrypting 3...")
let ct = Shortint.encrypt(cks, BigInt(3));
// Demonstrate ClientKey serialization (for example saving it on disk on the user device)
let serialized_cks = Shortint.serialize_client_key(cks);
// Deserialization
let deserialized_cks = Shortint.deserialize_client_key(serialized_cks);
// Demonstrate ciphertext serialization to send over the network
let serialized_ct = Shortint.serialize_ciphertext(ct);
// Deserialize a ciphertext received over the network for example
let deserialized_ct = Shortint.deserialize_ciphertext(serialized_ct);
// Decrypt with the deserialized objects
console.log("Decrypting ciphertext...")
let decrypted = Shortint.decrypt(deserialized_cks, deserialized_ct);
// Check decryption works as expected
assert.deepStrictEqual(decrypted, BigInt(3));
console.log("Decryption successful!")
// Generate public evaluation keys, also called ServerKey
console.log("Generating compressed ServerKey...")
let sks = Shortint.new_compressed_server_key(cks);
// Can be serialized to send over the network to the machine doing the evaluation
let serialized_sks = Shortint.serialize_compressed_server_key(sks);
let deserialized_sks = Shortint.deserialize_compressed_server_key(serialized_sks);
console.log("All done!")
}

# Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic parity bitThis tutorial shows how to build a small function that homomorphically computes a parity bit in 2 steps:Write a non-generic functionUse generics to handle the case where the function inputs are both FheBools and clear bools.The parity bit function processes two parameters:A slice of BooleanA mode (Odd or Even)This function returns a Boolean (true or false) so that the total count of true values across the input and the result matches with the specified parity mode (Odd or Even).Non-generic version
tfhe = { version = "~1.1.3", features = ["integer"] }First, define the verification function.The function initializes the parity bit to false, then applies the XOR operation across all bits, adding negation based on the requested mode.The validation function also adds the number of the bits set in the input to the computed parity bit and checks whether the sum is even or odd, depending on the mode.

}Generic versionTo enable the compute_parity_bit function to operate with both encrypted FheBool and plain bool, we introduce generics. This approach allows for validation using clear data and facilitates debugging.Writing generic functions that incorporate operator overloading for our Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) types is more complex than usual because FHE types do not implement the Copy trait. Consequently, it is necessary to use references (&) with these types, unlike native types, which typically implement Copy.This complicates generic bounds at first.Writing the correct trait boundsThe function has the following signature: fhe_bits: &[FheBool],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> boolTo make it generic, the first steps is: fhe_bits: &[BoolType],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> BoolTypeNext, define the generic bounds with the where clause.In the function, you can use the following operators:! (trait: Not)^ (trait: BitXor)Adding them to where, it gives: BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, the compiler will return an error:error[E0369]: no implementation for `&BoolType ^ BoolType`

error: aborting due to previous errorfhe_bit is a reference to a BoolType (&BoolType), because BoolType is borrowed from the fhe_bits slice during iteration.

# Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rs

Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageParallelized PBSThis document describes the implementation and benefits of parallelized Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) in TFHE-rs, including code examples for using multi-bit PBS parameters and ensuring deterministic execution.Parallelized Programmable BootstrappingProgrammable Bootstrapping is inherently a sequential operation. However, some recent results showed that introducing parallelism is feasible at the expense of larger keys, thereby enhancing the performance of PBS. This new PBS is called a multi-bit PBS.TFHE-rs can already perform parallel execution of integer homomorphic operations. Activating this feature can lead to performance improvements, particularly in the case of high core-count CPUs when enough cores are available, or when dealing with operations that require small input message precision.The following example shows how to use parallelized bootstrapping by choosing multi-bit PBS parameters: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_1::V1_1_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(V1_1_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())
}Deterministic parallelized Programmable BootstrappingBy nature, the parallelized PBS might not be deterministic: while the resulting ciphertext will always decrypt to the correct plaintext, the order of the operations could vary, resulting in different output ciphertext. To ensure a consistent ciphertext output regardless of execution order, add the with_deterministic_execution() suffix to the parameters.Here's an example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_1::V1_1_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let gpu_key = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;

let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);

let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;

}Beware that when the GPU feature is activated, when calling: let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();, the cryptographic parameters differ from the CPU ones, used when the GPU feature is not activated. Indeed, TFHE-rs uses dedicated parameters for the GPU in order to achieve better performance.Setting the keysThe configuration of the key is different from the CPU. More precisely, if both client and server keys are still generated by the client (which is assumed to run on a CPU), the server key has then to be decompressed by the server to be converted into the right format. To do so, the server should run this function: decompressed_to_gpu().Once decompressed, the operations between CPU and GPU are identical.EncryptionOn the client-side, the method to encrypt the data is exactly the same than the CPU one, as shown in the following example: let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);ComputationThe server first need to set up its keys with set_server_key(gpu_key).Then, homomorphic computations are performed using the same approach as the CPU operations. set_server_key(gpu_key);
let result = a + b;

# Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rs

Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationMulti-GPU supportThis guide explains the multi GPU support of TFHE-rs, and walks through a practical example of performing a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions using manual GPU
dispatching to improve the performance.Multi-GPU support overviewTFHE-rs supports platforms with multiple GPUs. There is nothing to change in the code to execute on such platforms. To keep the API as user-friendly as possible, the configuration is automatically set, i.e., the user has no fine-grained control over the number of GPUs to be used.
However, you can decide to have operations be executed on a single GPU of your choice.
In many cases this provides better throughput than using all the available GPUs to perform the operation.
Indeed, except for integer precisions above 64 bits and for the multiplication, which involves many bootstrap computations in parallel, most operations on up to 64 bits do not necessitate the full power of a GPU.
You will then be able to maximize throughput on multiple GPUs with TFHE-rs.Improving throughput on multiple-GPUsBy default, when multiple GPUs are available on the machine, TFHE-rs automatically uses them all
to perform encrypted operations. Under the hood, it includes a hard-coded logic to dispatch work across all the GPUs and to copy essential data—like the server key—to each GPU.
This approach is efficient for operations that load the GPU extensively (e.g. the 64-bit multiplication),
but not so much for smaller operations like the encrypted addition or comparison on 64-bits.
To address this, TFHE-rs also provides a mechanism to manually select which GPU to operate on.Dispatch operations on the GPUs of your choiceWhen selecting a specific GPU to execute on, there are two essential requirements that are different from a default GPU execution:You must create a GPU server key on each GPU individually.The batch of operations must be distributed on all the GPUs manually.Step 1: Decompress the server key to each GPUInstead of a single server key being used across all GPUs automatically, you’ll need specifically decompress the server key to each GPU, so that the key is available in memory.
For example, by default, the GPU server key is decompressed and loaded onto all available GPUs automatically as follows: tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let sks = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
}However, to use the multi-GPU selection feature, you can create a vector of server keys, each on a specific GPU:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}Step 2: Define the inputs to operate onWe will be doing 100 additions in parallel on each GPU:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}At this stage, the left and right inputs reside on the CPU. They have not yet been copied to the GPU.Step3: Dispatch the workloadsNow you need to split the calculation into as many chunks as there are GPUs.
TFHE-rs allows you to execute additions in parallel across multiple GPUs by leveraging CUDA streams.
CUDA stream management is not explicit in the High-Level(HL) API of TFHE-rs: streams are implicitly
created through calls to set_server_key in a CPU thread.
As a result, when you use .par_iter() on encrypted data within the HL API, and that computation is dispatched to a GPU, it behaves as expected—executing in parallel using CUDA streams.
We’ll take advantage of this behavior to maximize throughput on a multi-GPU machine. In the following example, we split a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions across multiple GPUs. Each GPU processes its own chunk of data in parallel, thanks to the creation of CUDA streams under the hood:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
left_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(
right_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
)
.enumerate()
.for_each(
|(i, (left_inputs_on_gpu_i, right_inputs_on_gpu_i))| {
left_inputs_on_gpu_i
.par_iter()
.zip(right_inputs_on_gpu_i.par_iter())
.for_each(|(left_input, right_input)| {
set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone());
let _ = left_input + right_input;
});
},
);
}In this example, par_chunks divides the input vectors into num_gpus chunks—one per GPU. Each chunk is then processed in parallel using .par_iter(). Inside the inner loop, calling set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone()) sets the context for the GPU i and implicitly creates a new CUDA stream for GPU i. This enables parallel execution on each device.
It’s important to note that, in this example, when using the + operator on encrypted inputs, data is first transferred from the CPU to the GPU before computation, the result then resides on the GPU i.
You can learn more about how to inspect on which GPU a piece of data resides from the examples in this file: tfhe/src/high_level_api/tests/gpu_selection.rs.Going beyond: Restrict the number of CUDA streamsWhile the behavior of .par_iter() in TFHE-rs' HL API aligns with expectations and provides parallelism over encrypted data, it can become a performance bottleneck in some cases. This is due to the way CUDA streams are managed.
CUDA streams allow for parallel execution on the GPU, but when too many are created, scheduling becomes inefficient. Instead of running in parallel, operations may fall back to sequential execution. In practice, having more than 10 streams already starts to negatively impact throughput.
To address this, we can limit the number of streams used per GPU. The optimal number depends on the type of operation, but the general rule is: use as few streams as possible while still fully utilizing the GPU.
For example, in the case of 64-bit encrypted additions, using 4 streams per GPU offers a good balance. Each GPU processes inputs in chunks of 4 operations in parallel, repeating this in batches until all inputs are handled.
Here’s how this approach looks in code:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let amounts = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
let num_streams_per_gpu = 4;
left_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(
right_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(amounts.par_chunks(chunk_size)),
)
.enumerate()
.for_each(
|(i, (left_inputs_gpu_i, (right_inputs_gpu_i, amount_gpu_i)))| {
let stream_chunk_size = left_inputs_gpu_i.len() / num_streams_per_gpu;
left_inputs_gpu_i
.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size)
.zip(right_inputs_gpu_i.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size))
.zip(amount_gpu_i.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size))
.for_each(
|((left_inputs_chunk, right_inputs_chunk), amount_chunk)| {
set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone());
left_inputs_chunk
.iter()
.zip(right_inputs_chunk.iter().zip(amount_chunk.iter()))
.for_each(|(left_input, (right_input, amount))| {
let _ = left_input + right_input;
});
},
);
},
);
}In this version, we:Define a number of streams per GPUSplit the load between the streams by calling par_chunks() on the batch assigned to each GPU.
This method provides a more fine-controlled form of parallelism, reaching an optimal performance on multiple GPUs with TFHE-rs.PreviousArray typesNextParallelized PBSLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore crypto APIQuick startThe core_crypto module from TFHE-rs is dedicated to the implementation of the cryptographic tools related to TFHE. To construct an FHE application, the shortint and/or Boolean modules (based on core_crypto) are recommended.The core_crypto module offers an API to low-level cryptographic primitives and objects, like lwe_encryption or rlwe_ciphertext. The goal is to propose an easy-to-use API for cryptographers.The overall code architecture is split in two parts: one for entity definitions and another focused on algorithms. The entities contain the definition of useful types, like LWE ciphertext or bootstrapping keys. The algorithms are then naturally defined to work using these entities.The API is convenient to add or modify existing algorithms, or to have direct access to the raw data. Even if the LWE ciphertext object is defined, along with functions giving access to the body, it is also possible to bypass these to get directly the ithi^{th}ith element of LWE mask.For instance, the code to encrypt and then decrypt a message looks like: tfhe::core_crypto::prelude::*;
// DISCLAIMER: these toy example parameters are not guaranteed to be secure or yield correct
// computations
// Define parameters for LweCiphertext creation
let lwe_dimension = LweDimension(742);
let lwe_noise_distribution =
Gaussian::from_dispersion_parameter(StandardDev(0.000007069849454709433), 0.0);

lwe_noise_distribution,
&mut encryption_generator,
);
let decrypted_plaintext = decrypt_lwe_ciphertext(&lwe_secret_key, &lwe);

let decomposer = SignedDecomposer::new(DecompositionBaseLog(4), DecompositionLevelCount(1));

# Boolean | TFHE-rs

Boolean | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanIn tfhe::boolean, the available operations are mainly related to their equivalent Boolean gates (i.e., AND, OR... etc). What follows are examples of a unary gate (NOT) and a binary gate (XOR). The last one is about the ternary MUX gate, which allows homomorphic computation of conditional statements of the form If..Then..Else.This library is meant to be used both on the server side and the client side. The typical use case should follow the subsequent steps:On the client side, generate the client and server keys.Send the server key to the server.Then any number of times:On the client side, encrypt the input data with the client key.Transmit the encrypted input to the server.On the server side, perform homomorphic computation with the server key.Transmit the encrypted output to the client.On the client side, decrypt the output data with the client key.SetupIn the first step, the client creates two keys, the client key and the server key, with the tfhe::boolean::gen_keys function: tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate the client key and the server key,
// using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key): (ClientKey, ServerKey) = gen_keys();
}The client_key is of type ClientKey. It is secret and must never be transmitted. This key will only be used to encrypt and decrypt data.The server_key is of type ServerKey. It is a public key and can be shared with any party. This key has to be sent to the server because it is required for homomorphic computation.Note that both the client_key and server_key implement the Serialize and Deserialize traits. This way you can use any compatible serializer to store/send the data. To store the server_key in a binary file, you can use the bincode library:use std::io::{Write, Read};
use tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE ----------------------------
// We generate a client key and a server key, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
// We serialize the server key to bytes, and store them in a file:
let encoded: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&server_key).unwrap();
// Create a tmp dir with the current user name to avoid cluttering the /tmp dir
let user = std::env::var("USER").unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_user".to_string());
let tmp_dir_for_user = &format!("/tmp/{user}");
create_dir_all(tmp_dir_for_user).unwrap();
let server_key_file = &format!("{tmp_dir_for_user}/tutorial_server_key.bin");
// We write the server key to a file:
let mut file = File::create(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to create server key file");
file.write_all(encoded.as_slice()).expect("failed to write key to file");
// ...
// We send the key to server side
// ...
//---------------------------- SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We read the file:
let mut file = File::open(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to open server key file");
let mut encoded: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
file.read_to_end(&mut encoded).expect("failed to read key");
// We deserialize the server key:
let key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize(&encoded[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
}Encrypting inputsOnce the server key is available on the server side, it is possible to perform some homomorphic computations. The client needs to encrypt some data and send it to the server. Again, the Ciphertext type implements the Serialize and the Deserialize traits, so that any serializer and communication tool suiting your use case can be employed:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE
// We use the client key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts:
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server somehow
// ...
}Encrypting inputs using a public keyAnyone (the server or a third party) with the public key can also encrypt some (or all) of the inputs.
The public key can only be used to encrypt, not to decrypt.
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//---------------------------- SERVER or THIRD_PARTY SIDE
// We use the public key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts (if not on the server already):
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server to be deserialized (if not on the server already)
// ...
}Executing a Boolean circuitOnce the encrypted inputs are on the server side, the server_key can be used to homomorphically execute the desired Boolean circuit:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We deserialize the ciphertexts:
let ct_1: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_1[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
let ct_2: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_2[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// We use the server key to execute the boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);
// Then we serialize the output of the circuit:
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6)
.expect("failed to serialize output");
// ...
// And we send the output to the client
// ...
}Decrypting the outputOnce the encrypted output is on the client side, the client_key can be used to decrypt it:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_6 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON CLIENT SIDE
// We deserialize the output ciphertext:
let output: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_output[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// Finally, we decrypt the output:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&output);
// And check that the result is the expected one:
assert!(output);

# Integer | TFHE-rs

Integer | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegertfhe::integer is dedicated to integers smaller than 256 bits. The steps to homomorphically evaluate an integer circuit are described here.Key Typesinteger provides 3 basic key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages, thus this key is meant to be kept private and should never be shared. This key is created from parameter values that will dictate both the security and efficiency of computations. The parameters also set the maximum number of bits of message encrypted in a ciphertext.The ServerKey is the key that is used to actually do the FHE computations. It contains a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key. This key is created from a ClientKey that needs to be shared to the server, so it is not meant to be kept private. A user with a ServerKey can compute on the encrypted data sent by the owner of the associated ClientKey.To reflect this, computation/operation methods are tied to the ServerKey type.The PublicKey is a key used to encrypt messages. It can be publicly shared to allow users to encrypt data such that only the ClientKey holder will be able to decrypt. Encrypting with the PublicKey does not alter the homomorphic capabilities associated to the ServerKey.1. Key GenerationTo generate the keys, a user needs two parameters:A set of shortint cryptographic parameters.The number of ciphertexts used to encrypt an integer (we call them "shortint blocks").We are now going to build a pair of keys that can encrypt 8-bit integers (signed or unsigned) by using 4 shortint blocks that store 2 bits of message each.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}2. Encrypting valuesOnce we have our keys, we can encrypt values:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}3. Encrypting values with the public keyOnce the client key is generated, the public key can be derived and used to encrypt data.use tfhe::integer::PublicKey;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
//We generate the public key from the secret client key:
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//encryption
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the public key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg1, num_block);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg2, num_block);
}4. Computing and decryptingWith our server_key, and encrypted values, we can now do an addition and then decrypt the result.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128;
let msg2 = 13;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.add_parallelized(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsQuick startThis library makes it possible to execute homomorphic operations over encrypted data, where the data are either Booleans, short integers (named shortint in the rest of this documentation), or integers up to 256 bits. It allows you to execute a circuit on an untrusted server because both circuit inputs and outputs are kept private. Data are indeed encrypted on the client side, before being sent to the server. On the server side, every computation is performed on ciphertexts.The server, however, has to know the circuit to be evaluated. At the end of the computation, the server returns the encryption of the result to the user. Then the user can decrypt it with the secret key.General method to write an homomorphic circuit programThe overall process to write an homomorphic program is the same for all types. The basic steps for using the TFHE-rs library are the following:Choose a data type (Boolean, shortint, integer)Import the libraryCreate client and server keysEncrypt data with the client keyCompute over encrypted data using the server keyDecrypt data with the client keyAPI levels.This library has different modules, with different levels of abstraction.There is the core_crypto module, which is the lowest level API with the primitive functions and types of the TFHE scheme.Above the core_crypto module, there are the Boolean, shortint, and integer modules, which contain easy to use APIs enabling evaluation of Boolean, short integer, and integer circuits.Finally, there is the high-level module built on top of the Boolean, shortint, integer modules. This module is meant to abstract cryptographic complexities: no cryptographical knowledge is required to start developing an FHE application. Another benefit of the high-level module is the drastically simplified development process compared to lower level modules.high-level APITFHE-rs exposes a high-level API by default that includes datatypes that try to match Rust's native types by having overloaded operators (+, -, ...).Here is an example of how the high-level API is used:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
let result = a + b;
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);

let clear_a = 2382u16;
let clear_b = 29374u16;

Shortint | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortinttfhe::shortint is dedicated to the manipulation of small unsigned integers that fit in a single LWE ciphertext. The actual size depends on the chosen parameters, but is always smaller than 8 bits. For example, with the PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameters, you can encode messages of 2 bits inside a shortint.The integer and high-level API leverage shortints to allow homomorphic computations over larger integers.The steps to homomorphically evaluate a shortint circuit are described below.Key generationtfhe::shortint provides 3 key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages (small integer values). It is meant to be kept private and should never be shared. This key is created from parameter values that will dictate both the security and efficiency of computations. The parameters also set the maximum number of bits of message encrypted in a ciphertext.The ServerKey is the key that is used to evaluate the FHE computations. Most importantly, it contains a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key. This key is created from a ClientKey that needs to be shared to the server (it is not meant to be kept private). A user with a ServerKey can compute on the encrypted data sent by the owner of the associated ClientKey.Computation/operation methods are tied to the ServerKey type.The PublicKey is the key used to encrypt messages. It can be publicly shared to allow users to encrypt data such that only the ClientKey holder will be able to decrypt. Encrypting with the PublicKey does not alter the homomorphic capabilities associated to the ServerKey. tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
}Encrypting valuesOnce the keys have been generated, the client key is used to encrypt data:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Encrypting values using a public keyOnce the keys have been generated, the client key is used to encrypt data:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Computing and decryptingUsing the server_key, addition is possible over encrypted values. The resulting plaintext is recovered after the decryption via the secret client key.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);

// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.add(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintOperationsThe structure and operations related to short integers are described in this section.How a shortint is representedIn shortint, the encrypted data is stored in an LWE ciphertext.Conceptually, the message stored in an LWE ciphertext is divided into a carry buffer and a message buffer.The message buffer is the space where the actual message is stored. This represents the modulus of the input messages (denoted by MessageModulus in the code). When doing computations on a ciphertext, the encrypted message can overflow the message modulus. The part of the message which exceeds the message modulus is stored in the carry buffer. The size of the carry buffer is defined by another modulus, called CarryModulus.Together, the message modulus and the carry modulus form the plaintext space that is available in a ciphertext. This space cannot be overflowed, otherwise the computation may result in an incorrect output.In order to ensure the correctness of the computation, we track the maximum value encrypted in a ciphertext via an associated attribute called the degree. When the degree reaches a defined threshold, the carry buffer may be emptied to safely resume the computations. In shortint the carry modulus is considered useful as a means to do more computations.Types of operationsThe operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted valuesscalar operations that take at least one non-encrypted value as inputFor example, the addition has two variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (a so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space. Using this operation might have an impact on the correctness of the following operations;checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely;smart: always does the operation. If the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will clear the carry to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is to allow the modification of the carry, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value;default: always does the operation and always clears the carry. Could be slower than smart, but it ensures that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use operation typesLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of operations that we have already introduced. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavour may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise,checked and smart are the best options.Let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and a multiplication.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
println!("expected {}, found {}", ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus, output);
}During this computation, the carry buffer has been overflowed and, as all the operations were unchecked, the output may be incorrect.If we redo this same circuit with the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use std::error::Error;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ops = || -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
server_key.checked_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar)?;
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2)?;
server_key.checked_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2)?;
Ok(())
};
match ops() {
Ok(_) => (),
Err(e) => {
println!("correctness of operations is not guaranteed due to error: {e}");
return;
},
}
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be cleaned during the computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.smart_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings as long as this is the only kind of operation which is used.Using default could slow-down computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}#List of available operationsCertain operations can only be used if the parameter set chosen is compatible with the bivariate programmable bootstrapping, meaning the carry buffer is larger than or equal to the message buffer. These operations are marked with a star (*).The list of implemented operations for shortint is:addition between two ciphertextsaddition between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalarcomparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalardivision of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarLSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the result truncated to fit in the message buffermultiplication of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarbitwise shift <<, >>subtraction of a ciphertext by another ciphertextsubtraction of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarnegation of a ciphertextbitwise and, or and xor (*)comparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between two ciphertexts (*)division between two ciphertexts (*)MSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the part overflowing the message buffer (*)Public key encryption.TFHE-rs supports both private and public key encryption methods. The only difference between both lies in the encryption step: in this case, the encryption method is called using public_key instead of client_key.Here is a small example on how to use public encryption:
fn main() {
// Generate the client key and the server key:
let (cks, _) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let pks = PublicKey::new(&cks);
let msg = 2;
// Encryption of one message:
let ct = pks.encrypt(msg);
// Decryption:
let dec = cks.decrypt(&ct);
assert_eq!(dec, msg);
}Arithmetic operations.Classical arithmetic operations are supported by shortint:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_add(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 + msg2) % modulus);
}bitwise operationsShort homomorphic integer types support some bitwise operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to homomorphically compute a bitwise AND:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_bitand(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 & msg2) % modulus);
}comparisonsShort homomorphic integer types support comparison operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_greater_or_equal(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 >= msg2) as u64 % modulus);
}univariate function evaluationsA simple example on how to use this operation to homomorphically compute the hamming weight (i.e., the number of bits equal to one) of an encrypted number.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
// We use the private client key to encrypt a message:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
// Compute the lookup table for the univariate function:
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table(|n| n.count_ones().into());
// Apply the table lookup on the input message:
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table(&ct_1, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, msg1.count_ones() as u64);
}bi-variate function evaluationsUsing the shortint types offers the possibility to evaluate bi-variate functions, or functions that take two ciphertexts as input. This requires choosing a parameter set such that the carry buffer size is at least as large as the message (i.e., PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with X <= Y).Here is a simple code example:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// Compute the lookup table for the bivariate functions
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table_bivariate(|x,y| (x.count_ones()
+ y.count_ones()) as u64 % modulus );
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table_bivariate(&ct_1, &ct_2, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1.count_ones() as u64 + msg2.count_ones() as u64) % modulus);

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintCryptographic parametersAll parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator, with an error probability equal to 2−642^{-64}2−64 when using programmable bootstrapping. This error probability is due to the randomness added at each encryption (see here for more details about the encryption process).Parameters and message precisionshortint comes with sets of parameters that permit the use of the library functionalities securely and efficiently. Each parameter set is associated to the message and carry precisions. Therefore, each key pair is entangled to precision.The user is allowed to choose which set of parameters to use when creating the pair of keys.The difference between the parameter sets is the total amount of space dedicated to the plaintext, how it is split between the message buffer and the carry buffer, and the order in which the keyswitch (KS) and bootstrap (PBS) are computed. The syntax chosen for the name of a parameter is: PARAM_MESSAGE_{number of message bits}_CARRY_{number of carry bits}_{KS_PBS | PBS_KS}. For example, the set of parameters for a message buffer of 5 bits, a carry buffer of 2 bits and where the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrap is PARAM_MESSAGE_5_CARRY_2_KS_PBS.Note that the KS_PBS order should have better performance at the expense of ciphertext size, PBS_KS is the opposite.This example contains keys that are generated to have messages encoded over 2 bits (i.e., computations are done modulus 22=42^2 = 422=4) with 2 bits of carry.The PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameter set is the default shortint parameter set that you can also use through the tfhe::shortint::prelude::DEFAULT_PARAMETERS constant. tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Impact of parameters on the operationsAs shown here, the choice of the parameter set impacts the operations available and their efficiency.Generic bi-variate functions.The computations of bi-variate functions is based on a trick: concatenating two ciphertexts into one. Where the carry buffer is not at least as large as the message buffer, this trick no longer works. In this case, many bi-variate operations, such as comparisons, cannot be correctly computed. The only exception concerns multiplication.Multiplication.In the case of multiplication, two algorithms are implemented: the first one relies on the bi-variate function trick, where the other one is based on the quarter square method. To correctly compute a multiplication, the only requirement is to have at least one bit of carry (i.e., using parameter sets PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with Y>=1). This method is slower than using the other one. Using the smart version of the multiplication automatically chooses which algorithm is used depending on the chosen parameters.User-defined parameter setsIt is possible to define new parameter sets. To do so, it is sufficient to use the function new() or to manually fill the ClassicPBSParameters structure fields.For instance:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::DynamicDistribution;
fn main() {
// WARNING: might be insecure and/or incorrect
// You can create your own set of parameters
let param = ClassicPBSParameters {

Serialization/Deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintSerialization/DeserializationAs explained in the introduction, some types (Serverkey, Ciphertext) are meant to be shared with the server that performs the computations.The easiest way to send these data to a server is to use the serialization and deserialization features. tfhe::shortint uses the serde framework. Serde's Serialize and Deserialize are then implemented on the tfhe::shortint types.To serialize the data, we need to pick a data format. For our use case, bincode is a good choice, mainly because it is a binary format.

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanCryptographic parametersDefault parametersThe TFHE cryptographic scheme relies on a variant of Regev cryptosystem and is based on a problem so difficult that it is even post-quantum resistant.Some cryptographic parameters will require tuning to ensure both the correctness of the result and the security of the computation.To make it simpler, we've provided two sets of parameters, which ensure correct computations for a certain probability with the standard security of 128 bits. There exists an error probability due to the probabilistic nature of the encryption, which requires adding randomness (noise) following a Gaussian distribution. If this noise is too large, the decryption will not give a correct result. There is a trade-off between efficiency and correctness: generally, using a less efficient parameter set (in terms of computation time) leads to a smaller risk of having an error during homomorphic evaluation.In the two proposed sets of parameters, the only difference lies in this error probability. The default parameter set ensures an error probability of at most 2−642^{-64}2−64 when computing a programmable bootstrapping (i.e., any gates but the not). The other one is closer to the error probability claimed in the original TFHE paper, namely 2−1652^{-165}2−165, but it is up-to-date regarding security requirements.The following array summarizes this:DEFAULT_PARAMETERS2−642^{-64}2−64TFHE_LIB_PARAMETERS2−1652^{-165}2−165User-defined parametersYou can also create your own set of parameters.

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerOperationsThe structure and operations related to integers are described in this section.How an integer is representedIn integer, the encrypted data is split amongst many ciphertexts encrypted with the shortint library. Below is a scheme representing an integer composed by k shortint ciphertexts.This crate implements two ways to represent an integer:the Radix representationthe CRT (Chinese Reminder Theorem) representationRadix-based integers.The first possibility to represent a large integer is to use a Radix-based decomposition on the plaintexts. Let B∈NB \in \mathbb{N}B∈N be a basis such that the size of BBB is smaller than (or equal to) 4 bits. Then, an integer m∈Nm \in \mathbb{N}m∈N can be written as m=m0+m1∗B+m2∗B2+...m = m_0 + m_1*B + m_2*B^2 + ...m=m0​+m1​∗B+m2​∗B2+..., where each mim_imi​ is strictly smaller than BBB. Each mim_imi​ is then independently encrypted. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.The definition of an integer requires a basis and a number of blocks. These parameters are chosen at key generation. Below, the keys are dedicated to integers encrypting messages over 8 bits, using a basis over 2 bits (i.e., B=22B=2^2B=22) and 4 blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}In this representation, the correctness of operations requires the carries to be propagated throughout the ciphertext. This operation is costly, since it relies on the computation of many programmable bootstrapping operations over shortints.CRT-based integers.The second approach to represent large integers is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this case, the basis BBB is composed of several integers bib_ibi​, such that there are pairwise coprime, and each b_ib\_ib_i has a size smaller than 4 bits. The CRT-based integer are defined modulus ∏bi\prod b_i∏bi​. For an integer mmm, its CRT decomposition is simply defined as m mod b0,m mod b1,...m \bmod{b_0}, m \bmod{b_1}, ...mmodb0​,mmodb1​,.... Each part is then encrypted as a shortint ciphertext. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.In the following example, the chosen basis is B=[2,3,5]B = [2, 3, 5]B=[2,3,5]. The integer is defined modulus 2∗3∗5=302*3*5 = 302∗3∗5=30. There is no need to pre-size the number of blocks since it is determined from the number of values composing the basis. Here, the integer is split over three blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let basis = vec![2, 3, 5];
let cks = CrtClientKey::new(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, basis);
}This representation has many advantages: no carry propagation is required, cleaning the carry buffer of each ciphertext block is enough. This implies that operations can easily be parallelized. It also allows the efficient computation of PBS in the case where the function is CRT-compliant.A variant of the CRT is proposed where each block might be associated to a different key couple. Here, a keychain to the computations is required, but this may result in a performance improvement.List of available operationsThe list of operations available in integer depends on the type of representation:Negation✔️✔️Addition✔️✔️Scalar Addition✔️✔️Subtraction✔️✔️Scalar Subtraction✔️✔️Multiplication✔️✔️Scalar Multiplication✔️✔️Bitwise OR, AND, XOR✔️✔️Equality✔️✔️Left/Right Shift✔️✖️Comparisons <,<=,>, >=✔️✖️Min, Max✔️✖️Types of operationsMuch like shortint, the operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted values.scalar operations take at least one non-encrypted value as input.For example, the addition has both variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (the so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space.checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely.smart: always does the operation, if the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will propagate the carry buffer to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is because the inputs' carry might be cleaned, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value.default: always compute the operation and always clear the carry. Could be slower than smart, but ensure that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use each operation typeLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of already introduced operations. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavor may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise, checked and smart are the best options.As an example, let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and an addition.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
// The carry buffer has been overflowed, the result is not correct
assert_ne!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}During this computation the carry buffer has been overflowed, and the output may be incorrect as all the operations were unchecked.If the same circuit is done but using the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 2;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.checked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar).unwrap();
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2).unwrap();
let result = server_key.checked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
assert!(result.is_err());
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
// Only the scalar multiplication could be done
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar) - msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits the manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be propagated during the computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.smart_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}You must avoid cloning the inputs when calling smart operations to preserve performance. For instance, you SHOULD NOT have these kind of patterns in the code:The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings, as long as only this kind of operation is used. Only the parallelized version of the operations is provided.Using default could slow down computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.scalar_mul_assign_parallelized(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.sub_assign_parallelized(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.add_assign_parallelized(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);

Serialization/Deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerSerialization/DeserializationAs explained in the introduction, some types (Serverkey, Ciphertext) are meant to be shared with the server that does the computations.The easiest way to send these data to a server is to use the serialization and deserialization features. TFHE-rs uses the serde framework, so serde's Serialize and Deserialize are implemented.To be able to serialize our data, a data format needs to be picked. Here, bincode is a good choice, mainly because it is binary format.

# Debugging | TFHE-rs

Debugging | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingDebuggingThis document explains a feature to facilitate debugging.Starting from TFHE-rs 0.5, trivial ciphertexts introduce a new feature to facilitate debugging. This feature supports a debugger, print statements, and faster execution, significantly reducing waiting time and enhancing the development pace of FHE applications.Trivial ciphertexts are not secure. An application released/deployed in production must never receive trivial ciphertext from a client.To use this feature, simply call your circuits/functions with trivially encrypted values that are created using encrypt_trivial(instead of real encryptions that are created using encrypt): tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{set_server_key, generate_keys, ConfigBuilder, FheUint128};
fn mul_all(a: &FheUint128, b: &FheUint128, c: &FheUint128) -> FheUint128 {
// Use the debug format ('{:?}'), if you don't want to unwrap()
// and panic if the value is not a trivial.
println!(
"a: {:?}, b: {:?}, c: {:?}",
a.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
b.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
c.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
);
let tmp = a * b;
println!("a * b = {:?}", tmp.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>());
tmp * c
}
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default().build());
set_server_key(sks);
let a = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(1234u128);
let b = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(4567u128);
let c = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(89101112u128);
// since all inputs are trivially encrypted, this is going to be
// much faster
let result = mul_all(&a, &b, &c);
}This example is going to print:a * b = Ok(5635678)If any input to mul_all is not a trivial ciphertexts, the computations will be done 100% in FHE, and the program will output:a * b = Err(NotTrivialCiphertextError)Using trivial encryptions as input, the example runs in 980 ms on a standard 12-core laptop, compared to 7.5 seconds on a 128-core machine using real encryptions.PreviousGeneric trait boundsNextAdvanced Rust setupLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# PBS statistics | TFHE-rs

PBS statistics | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingPBS statisticsThis document explains how to use the PBS statistics feature in TFHE-rs' shortint API to assess the overall computational intensity in FHE applications.The shortint API now includes a global counter to track the number of Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) executed with the pbs-stats feature. This feature enables precise tracking of PBS executions in a circuit. It helps to estimate the overall compute intensity of FHE code using either the shortint, integer, or High-Level APIs.To know how many PBSes were executed, call get_pbs_count. To reset the PBS count, call reset_pbs_count. You can combine two functions to understand how many PBSes were executed in each part of your code.When combined with the debug mode, this feature allows for quick estimations during iterations on the FHE code.Here is an example of how to use the PBS counter: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::*;
pub fn main() {
// Config and key generation
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Encryption
let a = FheUint32::encrypt(42u32, &cks);
let b = FheUint32::encrypt(16u32, &cks);
// Set the server key
set_server_key(sks);
// Compute and get the PBS count for the 32 bits multiplication
let c = &a * &b;
let mul_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Reset the PBS count, and get the PBS count for a 32 bits bitwise AND
reset_pbs_count();
let d = &a & &b;
let and_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Display the result
println!("mul_32_count: {mul_32_count}");
println!("and_32_count: {and_32_count}");

# Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rs

Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingGeneric trait boundsThis document serves as a practical reference for implementing generic functions in Rust that use operators across mixed references and values. The following explanations help you to understand the trait bounds necessary to handle such operations.Operators such as +, *, >>, and so on are tied to traits in std:::ops. For instance, the + operator corresponds to std::ops::Add. When writing a generic function that uses the + operator, you need to specify std::ops::Add as a trait bound.The trait bound varies slightly depending on whether the left-hand side / right-hand side is an owned value or a reference. The following table shows the different scenarios:T $op TT: $Op<T, Output=T>T $op &TT: for<'a> $Op<&'a T, Output=T>&T $op Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<T, Output=T>&T $op &Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<&'a T, Output=T>The for<'a> syntax refers to the Higher-Rank Trait Bounds(HRTB).Using generic functions allows for clearer input handling, which simplifies the debugging.Example std::ops::{Add, Mul};

Strings | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageTypesStringsThis document explains the FheAsciiString type for handling encrypted strings in TFHE-rs.TFHE-rs has supports for ASCII strings with the type FheAsciiString.
You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=stringsStrings are not yet compatible with CompactCiphertextList and CompressedCiphertextListSupported OperationsA variety of common operations are supported for FheAsciiString. These include:Comparisons: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, eq_ignore_caseCase conversion: to_lowercase / to_uppercaseString checks: starts_with / ends_with / containsTrimming: trim_start / trim_end / trimPrefix/suffix operations: strip_prefix / strip_suffixSearch: find / rfindWhen encrypting strings, you can add padding to hide the actual length of strings.
The null character (b'\0') is used as the padding.
Here is an example:

// This adds 3 chars of padding to the chars of the input string
let padded_string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt_with_padding("tfhe-rs", 3, &cks).unwrap();

# Parameters | TFHE-rs

Parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore workflowParametersThis document explains how the choice of cryptographic parameters impacts both the security and efficiency of FHE algorithms. The chosen parameters determine the error probability (sometimes referred to failure probability) and overall performance of computations using fully homomorphic encryption. This error probability is due to the noisy nature of FHE computations (see here for more details about the encryption process).All parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator.Default parametersCurrently, the default parameters use blocks that contain 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry - a tweaked uniform (TUniform, defined here) noise distribution, and have a bootstrapping failure probability perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128.
These are particularly suitable for applications that need to be secure in the IND-CPA^D model (see here for more details).
The GPU backend still uses an error probability smaller than 2−642^{-64}2−64 by default. Those will be updated soon.When using the high-level API of TFHE-rs, you can create a key pair using the default recommended set of parameters. For example: tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations
}These default parameters may be updated with in future releases of TFHE-rs, potentially causing incompatibilities between versions. For production systems, it is therefore recommended to specify a fixed parameter set.Parameters versioning and naming schemeParameter sets are versioned for backward compatibility. This means that each set of parameters can be tied to a specific version of TFHE-rs, so that they remain unchanged and compatible after an upgrade.All parameter sets are stored as variables inside the tfhe::shortint::parameters module, with submodules named after the versions of TFHE-rs in which these parameters where added. For example, parameters added in TFHE-rs v1.0 can be found inside tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_1.The naming convention of these parameters indicates their capabilities. Taking tfhe::parameters::v1_1::V1_1_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128 as an example:V1_1: these parameters were introduced in TFHE-rs v1.0MESSAGE_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of messageCARRY_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of carryKS_PBS: the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrapTUNIFORM: the tweaked uniform noise distribution is used2M128: the probability of failure for the bootstrap is 2−1282^{-128}2−128For convenience, aliases are provided for the most used sets of parameters and stored in the module tfhe::shortint::parameters::aliases. Note, however, that these parameters are not stable over time and are always updated to the latest TFHE-rs version. For this reason, they should only be used for prototyping and are not suitable for production use cases.How to choose the parameter setsYou can override the default parameters with the with_custom_parameters(block_parameters) method of the Config object. For example, to use a Gaussian distribution instead of the TUniform one, you can modify your configuration as follows:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_1::V1_1_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
fn main() {
let config =
ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(V1_1_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128)
.build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations

# Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rs

Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingCompressing ciphertexts/keysThis document explains the mechanism and steps to compress ciphertext and keys to reduce the storage needed as well as transmission times.Most TFHE-rs entities contain random numbers generated by a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). Since the implemented PRNG is deterministic, storing only the random seed used to generate those numbers preserves all necessary information. When decompressing the entity, using the same PRNG and the same seed will reconstruct the full chain of random values.In TFHE-rs, compressible entities are prefixed with Compressed. For instance, a compressed FheUint256 is declared as CompressedFheUint256.In the following example code, we use the bincode crate dependency to serialize in a binary format and compare serialized sizes.Compressing CiphertextsCompressing ciphertexts at encryption timeThis example shows how to compress a ciphertext encrypting messages over 16 bits: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, CompressedFheUint16};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let clear = 12_837u16;
let compressed = CompressedFheUint16::try_encrypt(clear, &client_key).unwrap();
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed).unwrap().len()
);
let decompressed = compressed.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&decompressed).unwrap().len()
);
let clear_decompressed: u16 = decompressed.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear_decompressed, clear);
}Compression ciphertexts after some homomorphic computationYou can compress ciphertexts at any time, even after performing multiple homomorphic operations.To do so, you need to build a list containing all the ciphertexts that have to be compressed. This list might contain ciphertexts of different types, e.g., FheBool, FheUint32, FheInt64,...
There is no constraint regarding the size of the list.There are two possible approaches:Single list: Compressing several ciphertexts into a single list. This generally yields a better compression ratio between output and input sizes;Multiple lists: Using multiple lists. This offers more flexibility, since compression might happen at different times in the code, but could lead to larger outputs.In more details, the optimal ratio is achieved with a list whose size is
equal to the lwe_per_glwe field from the CompressionParameters.The following example shows how to compress and decompress a list containing 4 messages: one 32-bits integer, one 64-bit integer, one boolean, and one 2-bit integer.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2,
};
use tfhe::{
set_server_key, CompressedCiphertextList, CompressedCiphertextListBuilder, FheBool,
FheInt64, FheUint16, FheUint2, FheUint32,
};
fn main() {
let config =
tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.enable_compression(COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.build();
let ck = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let sk = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&ck);
set_server_key(sk);
let ct1 = FheUint32::encrypt(17_u32, &ck);
let ct2 = FheInt64::encrypt(-1i64, &ck);
let ct3 = FheBool::encrypt(false, &ck);
let ct4 = FheUint2::encrypt(3u8, &ck);
let compressed_list = CompressedCiphertextListBuilder::new()
.push(ct1)
.push(ct2)
.push(ct3)
.push(ct4)
.build()
.unwrap();
let serialized = bincode::serialize(&compressed_list).unwrap();
println!("Serialized size: {} bytes", serialized.len());
let compressed_list: CompressedCiphertextList = bincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
let a: FheUint32 = compressed_list.get(0).unwrap().unwrap();
let b: FheInt64 = compressed_list.get(1).unwrap().unwrap();
let c: FheBool = compressed_list.get(2).unwrap().unwrap();
let d: FheUint2 = compressed_list.get(3).unwrap().unwrap();
let a: u32 = a.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(a, 17);
let b: i64 = b.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(b, -1);
let c = c.decrypt(&ck);
assert!(!c);
let d: u8 = d.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(d, 3);
// Out of bound index
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheBool>(4).unwrap().is_none());
// Incorrect type
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheInt64>(0).is_err());
// Correct type but wrong number of bits
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheUint16>(0).is_err());
}Compressing keysCompressing server keysThis example shows how to compress the server keys:use tfhe::{
set_server_key, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8,
};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let cks = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_sks = CompressedServerKey::new(&cks);
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed_sks).unwrap().len()
);
let sks = compressed_sks.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&sks).unwrap().len()
);
set_server_key(sks);
let clear_a = 12u8;
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(clear_a, &cks).unwrap();
let c = a + 234u8;
let decrypted: u8 = c.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a.wrapping_add(234));
}
Compressed public keysThis example shows how to compress the classical public keys:It is not currently recommended to use the CompressedPublicKey to encrypt ciphertexts without first decompressing them. If the resulting PublicKey is too large to fit in memory, it may result in significant slowdowns.This issue has been identified and will be addressed in future releases.use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, CompressedPublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let compressed_public_key = CompressedPublicKey::new(&client_key);
println!("compressed size : {}", bincode::serialize(&compressed_public_key).unwrap().len());
let public_key = compressed_public_key.decompress();
println!("decompressed size: {}", bincode::serialize(&public_key).unwrap().len());
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(213u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear, 213u8);
}Compressed compact public keyThis example shows how to use compressed compact public keys:use tfhe::{

let public_key = public_key_compressed.decompress();

Data versioning | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingData versioningData versioning and backward compatibilityThis document explains how to save and load versioned data using the data versioning feature.Starting from v0.6.4, TFHE-rs supports versioned data types. This allows you to store data and load it in the future without compatibility concerns. This feature is done by the tfhe-versionable crate.This versioning scheme is compatible with all the data formats supported by serde.Saving and loading versioned dataTo use the versioning feature, wrap your types in their versioned equivalents before serialization using the versionize method.
You can load serialized data with the unversionize function, even in newer versions of TFHE-rs where the data types might evolve. The unversionize function manages any necessary data type upgrades, ensuring compatibility.

let loaded_ct =
FheUint8::unversionize(versioned_ct).unwrap();
let output: u8 = loaded_ct.decrypt(&loaded_client_key);
assert_eq!(msg, output);
}VersionizeCalling .versionize() on a value will add versioning tags. This is done recursively so all the subtypes that compose it are versioned too. Under the hood, it converts the value into an enum where each version of a type is represented by a new variant. The returned object can be serialized using serde: bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &versioned_client_key).unwrap();UnversionizeThe Type::unversionize() function takes a versioned value, upgrades it to the latest version of its type and removes the version tags. To do that, it matches the version in the versioned enum and eventually apply a conversion function that upgrades it to the most recent version. The resulting value can then be used inside TFHE-rs let loaded_client_key =
ClientKey::unversionize(versioned_client_key).unwrap();Breaking changesWhen possible, data will be upgraded automatically without any kind of interraction. However, some changes might need information that are only known by the user of the library. These are called data breaking changes. In these occasions, TFHE-rs provides a way to upgrade these types manually.You will find below a list of breaking changes and how to upgrade them.PreviousSerialization/deserializationNextAdvanced featuresLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs

*Source: tfhe-rs/1.1/fhe-computation/data-handling/serialization.html*

Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingSerialization/deserializationThis document explains the serialization and deserialization features that are useful to send data to a server to perform the computations.Safe serialization/deserializationWhen dealing with sensitive types, it's important to implement safe serialization and safe deserialization functions to prevent runtime errors and enhance security. TFHE-rs provide easy to use functions for this purpose, such as safe_serialize, safe_deserialize and safe_deserialize_conformant.Here is a basic example on how to use it:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, safe_serialize};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
// The last argument is the max allowed size for the serialized buffer
safe_serialize(&server_key, &mut buffer, 1 << 30).unwrap();
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}The safe deserialization must take the output of a safe-serialization as input. During the process, the following validation occurs:Type match: deserializing type A from a serialized type B raises an error indicating "On deserialization, expected type A, got type B".Version compatibility: data serialized in previous versions of TFHE-rs are automatically upgraded to the latest version using the data versioning feature.Parameter compatibility: deserializing an object of type A with one set of crypto parameters from an object of type A with another set of crypto parameters raises an error indicating "Deserialized object of type A not conformant with given parameter set"If both parameter sets have the same LWE dimension for ciphertexts, a ciphertext from param 1 may not fail this deserialization check with param 2.This check can't distinguish ciphertexts/server keys from independent client keys with the same parameters.This check is meant to prevent runtime errors in server homomorphic operations by checking that server keys and ciphertexts are compatible with the same parameter set.You can use the standalone is_conformant method to check parameter compatibility. Besides, the safe_deserialize_conformant function includes the parameter compatibility check, and the safe_deserialize function does not include the compatibility check.Size limit: both serialization and deserialization processes expect a size limit (measured in bytes) for the serialized data:On serialization, an error is raised if the serialized output exceeds the specific limit.On deserialization, an error is raised if the serialized input exceeds the specific limit.This feature aims to gracefully return an error in case of an attacker trying to cause an out-of-memory error on deserialization.Here is a more complete example:
use tfhe::conformance::ParameterSetConformant;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_serialize, safe_deserialize_conformant};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128};
use tfhe::conformance::ListSizeConstraint;
use tfhe::{
generate_keys, FheUint8, CompactCiphertextList, FheUint8ConformanceParams,
CompactPublicKey, ConfigBuilder, CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams
};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
let params_2 = PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
assert_ne!(params_1, params_2);
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let conformance_params_1 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_1);
let conformance_params_2 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_2);
let public_key = CompactPublicKey::new(&client_key);
let msg = 27u8;
let ct = FheUint8::try_encrypt(msg, &client_key).unwrap();
assert!(ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_1));
assert!(!ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_2));
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&ct, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
assert!(safe_deserialize_conformant::<FheUint8>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_2)
.is_err());
let ct2: FheUint8 = safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_1)
.unwrap();
let dec: u8 = ct2.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(msg, dec);
// Example with a compact list:
let msgs = [27, 188u8];
let mut builder = CompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key);
builder.extend(msgs.iter().copied());
let compact_list = builder.build();
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&compact_list, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
let conformance_params = CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams {
shortint_params: params_1.to_shortint_conformance_param(),
num_elements_constraint: ListSizeConstraint::exact_size(2),
};
safe_deserialize_conformant::<CompactCiphertextList>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params)
.unwrap();
}The safe serialization and deserialization use bincode internally.To selectively disable some of the features of the safe serialization, you can use SerializationConfig/DeserializationConfig builders. For example, it is possible to disable the data versioning:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, SerializationConfig};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
SerializationConfig::new(1 << 30).disable_versioning().serialize_into(&server_key, &mut buffer).unwrap();
// You will still be able to load this item with `safe_deserialize_conformant`, but only using the current version of TFHE-rs
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}Serialization/deserialization using serdeTFHE-rs uses the Serde framework and implements Serde's Serialize and Deserialize traits.This allows you to serialize into any data format supported by serde. However, this is a more bare bone approach as none of the checks described in the previous section will be performed for you.In the following example, we use bincode for its binary format:
[dependencies]
# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs
tfhe = { version = "~1.1.3", features = ["integer"] }
bincode = "1.3.3"
use std::io::Cursor;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, ServerKey, generate_keys, set_server_key, FheUint8};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>{
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
let value_1 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg1, &client_key);
let value_2 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg2, &client_key);
// Prepare to send data to the server
// The ClientKey is _not_ sent
let mut serialized_data = Vec::new();
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &server_key)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_1)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_2)?;
// Simulate sending serialized data to a server and getting
// back the serialized result
let serialized_result = server_function(&serialized_data)?;
let result: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize(&serialized_result)?;
let output: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(output, msg1 + msg2);
Ok(())
}
fn server_function(serialized_data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut serialized_data = Cursor::new(serialized_data);
let server_key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize_from(&mut serialized_data)?;
let ct_1: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize_from(&mut serialized_data)?;
let ct_2: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize_from(&mut serialized_data)?;

# Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rs

Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresEncrypted pseudo random valuesThis document explains the mechanism and steps to generate an oblivious encrypted random value using only server keys.The goal is to give to the server the possibility to generate a random value, which will be obtained in an encrypted format and will remain unknown to the server. The implementation is based on this article.This is possible through two methods on FheUint and FheInt:generate_oblivious_pseudo_random which return an integer taken uniformly in the full integer range ([0; 2^N[ for a FheUintN and [-2^(N-1); 2^(N-1)[ for a FheIntN).generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded which return an integer taken uniformly in [0; 2^random_bits_count[. For a FheUintN, we must have random_bits_count <= N. For a FheIntN, we must have random_bits_count <= N - 1.Both methods functions take a seed Seed as input, which could be any u128 value.
They both rely on the use of the usual server key.
The output is reproducible, i.e., the function is deterministic from the inputs: assuming the same hardware, seed and server key, this function outputs the same random encrypted value.Here is an example of the usage: tfhe::prelude::FheDecrypt;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8, FheInt8, Seed};
pub fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let random_bits_count = 3;
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(dec_result < (1 << random_bits_count));
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);

# Overflow detection | TFHE-rs

Overflow detection | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresOverflow detectionThis document explains how TFHE-rs implements specific operations to detect overflows in computations.The mechanism of detecting overflow consists in returning an encrypted flag with a specific ciphertext that reflects the state of the computation. When an overflow occurs, this flag is set to true. Since the server is not able to evaluate this encrypted value, the client has to check the flag value when decrypting to determine if an overflow has happened.These operations might be slower than their non-overflow-detecting equivalent, so they are not enabled by default. To use them, you must explicitly call specific operators. At the moment, only additions, subtractions, and multiplications are supported. We plan to add more operations in future releases.Here's the list of operations supported along with their symbol:Addoverflow_addBinarySuboverflow_subBinaryMuloverflow_mulBinaryThe usage of these operations is similar to the standard ones. The key difference is in the decryption process, as shown in following example:
//
// * The operation is modular, i.e on overflow the result wraps around.
// * On overflow the [FheBool] is true, otherwise false

# Public key encryption | TFHE-rs

Public key encryption | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresPublic key encryptionThis document explains public key encryption and provides instructions for 2 methods.Public key encryption refers to the cryptographic paradigm where the encryption key can be publicly distributed, whereas the decryption key remains secret to the owner. This differs from the usual case where the same secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. In TFHE-rs, there are two methods for public key encryptions:Classical public key: the first method involves the public key containing many encryptions of zero, as detailed in Guide to Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the [Discretized] Torus, Appendix A.Compact public key: the second method is based on the paper TFHE Public-Key Encryption Revisited, allowing for significantly smaller key sizes compared to the first method.Public keys can also be compressed to reduce size.Classical public keyThis example shows how to use classical public keys. tfhe::prelude::*;

let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);

# Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rs

Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresMulti-threading with Rayon crateThis document describes how to use Rayon for parallel processing in TFHE-rs, detailing configurations for single and multi-client applications with code examples.Rayon is a popular Rust crate that simplifies writing multi-threaded code. You can use Rayon to write multi-threaded TFHE-rs code. However, due to the specifications of Rayon and TFHE-rs, certain setups are necessary.Single-client applicationThe problemThe high-level API requires to call set_server_key on each thread where computations need to be done. So a first attempt to use Rayon with TFHE-rs might look like this: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
// set_server_key in each closure as they might be
// running in different threads
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
}However, due to Rayon's work-stealing mechanism and TFHE-rs' internals, this may create BorrowMutError.Working exampleThe correct way is to call rayon::broadcast as follows:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
// set the server key in all of the rayon's threads so that
// we won't need to do it later
rayon::broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks.clone()));
// Set the server key in the main thread
set_server_key(sks);
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
let a: u8 = a.decrypt(&cks);
let b: u8 = b.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(a, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b, 6u8);
}Multi-client applicationsFor applications that need to operate concurrently on data from different clients and require each client to use multiple threads, you need to create separate Rayon thread pools:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks1, sks1) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks1),
];
let ys1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks1),
];
let (cks2, sks2) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(100u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(200u8, &cks2),
];
let ys2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(103u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(204u8, &cks2),
];
let client_1_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
let client_2_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(2).build().unwrap();
client_1_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));
client_2_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks2.clone()));
let ((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) = rayon::join(|| {
client_1_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs1[0] + &ys1[0]
},
|| {
&xs1[1] + &ys1[1]
}
)
})
}, || {
client_2_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs2[0] + &ys2[0]
},
|| {
&xs2[1] + &ys2[1]
}
)
})
});
let a1: u8 = a1.decrypt(&cks1);
let b1: u8 = b1.decrypt(&cks1);
assert_eq!(a1, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b1, 6u8);
let a2: u8 = a2.decrypt(&cks2);
let b2: u8 = b2.decrypt(&cks2);
assert_eq!(a2, 203u8);
assert_eq!(b2, 148u8);
}This can be useful if you have some rust #[test], see the example below:#[test]
fn test_1() {
let pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));

For example, when computing the sum of a list of ciphertexts, you typically initialize the sum variable to 0.Instead of asking the client to send an actual encrypted zero, the server can use a trivial encryption. A trivial encryption creates a ciphertext that contains the desired value but isn't securely encrypted - essentially anyone, any key can decrypt it. tfhe::prelude::*;

# Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rs

Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresZero-knowledge proofsThis document explains how to implement the zero-knowledge proofs function for compact public key encryption to verify the encryption process without revealing the encrypted information.TFHE-rs can generate zero-knowledge proofs to verify that the compact public key encryption process is correct. In other words, TFHE-rs generates the proof without revealing any information other than the already known range of the encrypted message. This technique is derived from Libert’s work.You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=zk-pok when building TFHE-rs.To use this feature, you must first generate a CRS (Common Reference String). The CRS is a piece of cryptographic data that is necessary to ensure the security of zero-knowledge proofs. The CRS should be generated in advance and shared between all the clients and the server. A CRS can be reused for multiple encryptions with the same parameters.Once the CRS is generated, using zero-knowledge proofs is straightforward: during encryption, the client generates the proof, and the server validates it before performing any homomorphic computations.Note that you need to use dedicated parameters for the compact public key encryption. This helps to reduce the size of encrypted data and speed up the zero-knowledge proof computation.The following example shows how a client can encrypt and prove a ciphertext, and how a server can verify and compute the ciphertext: rand::prelude::*;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};
pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Indicate which parameters to use for the Compact Public Key encryption
let cpk_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_PKE_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// And parameters allowing to keyswitch/cast to the computation parameters.
let casting_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_KEYSWITCH_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Enable the dedicated parameters on the config
let config = tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params)
.use_dedicated_compact_public_key_parameters((cpk_params, casting_params)).build();
// The CRS should be generated in an offline phase then shared to all clients and the server
let crs = CompactPkeCrs::from_config(config, 64).unwrap();
// Then use TFHE-rs as usual
let client_key = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let server_key = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&client_key);
let public_key = tfhe::CompactPublicKey::try_new(&client_key).unwrap();
// This can be left empty, but if provided allows to tie the proof to arbitrary data
let metadata = [b'T', b'F', b'H', b'E', b'-', b'r', b's'];
let clear_a = rng.gen::<u64>();
let clear_b = rng.gen::<u64>();
let proven_compact_list = tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(clear_a)
.push(clear_b)
.build_with_proof_packed(&crs, &metadata, ZkComputeLoad::Verify)?;
// Server side
let result = {
set_server_key(server_key);
// Verify the ciphertexts
let expander =
proven_compact_list.verify_and_expand(&crs, &public_key, &metadata)?;
let a: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(0)?.unwrap();
let b: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(1)?.unwrap();
a + b
};
// Back on the client side
let a_plus_b: u64 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(a_plus_b, clear_a.wrapping_add(clear_b));
Ok(())
}Performance can be improved by setting lto="fat" in Cargo.tomllto = "fat"and by building the code for the native CPU architecture and in release mode, e.g. by calling RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release.You can choose a more costly proof with ZkComputeLoad::Proof, which has a faster verification time. Alternatively, you can select ZkComputeLoad::Verify for a faster proof and slower verification.Scheme versionThe ZK scheme used to generate and verify proofs is available in two versions:ZKV1: This version is close to the original paper from Libert.ZKV2: Differing from the paper, this version provides better performance for provers and verifiers.TFHE-rs selects automatically the scheme to use based on the encryption parameters during the CRS generation. With default parameters, ZKV2 is selected.The following example shows how to generate a CRS and proofs for ZKV1. Compared to the previous example, only the parameters are changed:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};
pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_1::V1_1_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Indicate which parameters to use for the Compact Public Key encryption

# Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringThis tutorial demonstrates how to build your own data type that represents an ASCII string in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) by implementing to_lower and to_upper functions.Since version 0.11, TFHE-rs has introduced the strings feature, which provides an easy to use FHE strings API. See the fhe strings guide for more information.An ASCII character is stored in 7 bits. In this tutorial, we use the FheUint8 to store an encrypted ASCII:The uppercase letters are in the range [65, 90]The lowercase letters are in the range [97, 122]The relationship between uppercase and lowercase letters is defined as follows:lower_case = upper_case + UP_LOW_DISTANCEupper_case = lower_case - UP_LOW_DISTANCEWhere UP_LOW_DISTANCE = 32Types and methodsThis type stores the encrypted characters as a Vec<FheUint8> to implement case conversion functions.To use the FheUint8 type, enable the integer feature:
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.1.3", features = ["integer"] }The MyFheString::encrypt function performs data validation to ensure the input string contains only ASCII characters.In FHE operations, direct branching on encrypted values is not possible. However, you can evaluate a boolean condition to obtain the desired outcome. Here is an example to check and convert the 'char' to a lowercase without using a branch:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
if c > 64 && c < 91 {
c + UP_LOW_DISTANCE
} else {
c
}
}You can remove the branch this way:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
c + ((c > 64) as u8 & (c < 91) as u8) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}This method can adapt to operations on homomorphic integers:
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::FheUint8;
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}Full example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ClientKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8};
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
struct MyFheString {
bytes: Vec<FheUint8>,
}
fn to_upper(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c - FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(96) & c.lt(123)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
impl MyFheString {
fn encrypt(string: &str, client_key: &ClientKey) -> Self {
assert!(
string.is_ascii(),
"The input string must only contain ascii letters"
);
let fhe_bytes: Vec<FheUint8> = string
.bytes()
.map(|b| FheUint8::encrypt(b, client_key))
.collect();
Self { bytes: fhe_bytes }
}
fn decrypt(&self, client_key: &ClientKey) -> String {
let ascii_bytes: Vec<u8> = self
.bytes
.iter()
.map(|fhe_b| fhe_b.decrypt(client_key))
.collect();
String::from_utf8(ascii_bytes).unwrap()
}
fn to_upper(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_upper).collect(),
}
}
fn to_lower(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_lower).collect(),
}
}
}
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string = MyFheString::encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key);
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_upper();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lower();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");
}Using TFHE-rs strings featureThis code can be greatly simplified by using the strings feature from TFHE-rs.First, add the feature in your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.1.3", features = ["strings"] }The FheAsciiString type allows to simply do homomorphic case changing of encrypted strings (and much more!):use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheAsciiString};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string =
FheAsciiString::try_encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key).unwrap();
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_uppercase();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lowercase();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");

# SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rs

SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSHA256 with Boolean APIThis tutorial guides you to convert a regular SHA-256 function to its homomorphic version, with considerations of optimal performances. You will learn:The basics of the SHA-256 function.The steps to implement SHA-256 homomorphically.SHA-256 basicsFirst, you need to implement the SHA-256 function. You can find the official specification for SHA-256 here. We summarize the three key aspects of SHA-256 outlined in the document:PaddingThe SHA-256 function processes the input data in blocks or chunks of 512 bits. Before performing the hash computations, prepare the data as follows:Append a single "1" bitAppend "0" bits until exactly 64 bits remain to make the message length a multiple of 512Append the last 64 bits as a binary encoding of the original input lengthIn this diagram, the numbers on the top represent the length of the padded input at each position. The formula L+1+k+64 ensures that the length reaches a multiple of 512, matching the required length of the padded input.Operations and functionsWe will use bitwise AND, XOR, NOT, addition modulo 2^32, the Rotate Right (ROTR) and Shift Right (SHR) operations as building blocks for functions inside the SHA-256 computation. These operations all use 32-bit words and produce new words.We combine these operations inside the sigma (with 4 variations), Ch, and Maj functions. When changing SHA-256 to the homomorphic computation, we will mainly change the code of each operation.Here is the definition of each function:Maj(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) XOR (y AND z)
Σ0(x) = ROTR-2(x) XOR ROTR-13(x) XOR ROTR-22(x)
Σ1(x) = ROTR-6(x) XOR ROTR-11(x) XOR ROTR-25(x)
σ0(x) = ROTR-7(x) XOR ROTR-18(x) XOR SHR-3(x)
σ1(x) = ROTR-17(x) XOR ROTR-19(x) XOR SHR-10(x)We simplify Maj using the Boolean distributive law: (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) = x AND (y XOR z), as shown below:We simplify Ch using a single bitwise multiplexer. Here's the truth table of the Ch expression.00000011010001111000101011011111This table shows that the result equals to z when x = 0, and the result equals to y when x = 1, which means if x {y} else {z}. Hence we can replace the 4 bitwise operations of Ch by a single bitwise multiplexer.All these operations can be evaluated homomorphically:ROTR and SHR: They can be evaluated by changing the index of each ecrypted bit of the word without using any homomorphic operation.Bitwise AND, XOR and multiplexer: They can be computed homomorphicallyAddition modulo 2^32: It can be broken down into boolean homomorphic operations.SHA-256 computationThe SHA-256 function processes data in 512-bit chunks. Here is what happens during computation:The 512-bit chunk is computed into 16 words, each containing 32 bits.Another 48 words are computed using the previous function.After computing the 64 words, within the same chunk, a compression loop will compute a hash value (8 32-bit words) using the previous functions and some constants to mix everything up.This entire process iterate through each 512-bit chunk of your data.When we finish the last chunk iteration, the resulting hash values will be the output of the SHA-256 function.Here is an example of this function using arrays of 32 bools to represent words:
// Initialize hash values with constant values
let mut hash: [[bool; 32]; 8] = [
hex_to_bools(0x6a09e667), hex_to_bools(0xbb67ae85),
hex_to_bools(0x3c6ef372), hex_to_bools(0xa54ff53a),
hex_to_bools(0x510e527f), hex_to_bools(0x9b05688c),
hex_to_bools(0x1f83d9ab), hex_to_bools(0x5be0cd19),
];
let chunks = padded_input.chunks(512);
for chunk in chunks {
let mut w = [[false; 32]; 64];
// Copy first 16 words from current chunk
for i in 0..16 {
w[i].copy_from_slice(&chunk[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32]);
}
// Compute the other 48 words
for i in 16..64 {
w[i] = add(add(add(sigma1(&w[i - 2]), w[i - 7]), sigma0(&w[i - 15])), w[i - 16]);
}
let mut a = hash[0];
let mut b = hash[1];
let mut c = hash[2];
let mut d = hash[3];
let mut e = hash[4];
let mut f = hash[5];
let mut g = hash[6];
let mut h = hash[7];
// Compression loop, each iteration uses a specific constant from K
for i in 0..64 {
let temp1 = add(add(add(add(h, ch(&e, &f, &g)), w[i]), hex_to_bools(K[i])), sigma_upper_case_1(&e));
let temp2 = add(sigma_upper_case_0(&a), maj(&a, &b, &c));
h = g;
g = f;
f = e;
e = add(d, temp1);
d = c;
c = b;
b = a;
a = add(temp1, temp2);
}
hash[0] = add(hash[0], a);
hash[1] = add(hash[1], b);
hash[2] = add(hash[2], c);
hash[3] = add(hash[3], d);
hash[4] = add(hash[4], e);
hash[5] = add(hash[5], f);
hash[6] = add(hash[6], g);
hash[7] = add(hash[7], h);
}
// Concatenate the final hash values to produce a 256-bit hash
let mut output = [false; 256];
for i in 0..8 {
output[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32].copy_from_slice(&hash[i]);
}
output
}Homomorphic SHA-256 on encrypted dataTo convert SHA-256 to a homomorphic version, you can replace each bit of padded_input with a fully homomorphic encryption of the same bit value and operate on the encrypted value using homomorphic operations.While the structure of the SHA-256 function remains the same, there are some important considerations in the code:The function signature and the borrowing rules should adapt to the ciphertext type (representing the encrypted bits).Implementing SHA-256 operations with homomorphic encryption uses homomorphic boolean operations internally.Homomorphic operations on encrypted data can be very expensive. Consider these options for better speed:Remove unnecessary use of homomorphic operations and maximize parallelization.Simplify the code with Rayon crate that parallelizes iterators and manages threads efficiently.The final code is available here.Now let's dive into details of each SHA256 operation.Rotate Right and Shift RightRotate Right and Shift Right can be evaluated by changing the position of each encrypted bit in the word, requiring no homomorphic operations. Here is the implementation: let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result
}
fn shift_right(x: &[Ciphertext; 32], n: usize, sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result[..n].fill_with(|| sk.trivial_encrypt(false));
result
}Bitwise XOR, AND, MultiplexerTo implement these operations, we will use the xor, and mux methods from the TFHE-rs library to perform each boolean operation homomorphically.For better efficiency, we can parallelize the homomorphic computations because we operate bitwise. It means that we can homomorphically XOR the bits at index 0 of two words using one thread while XORing the bits at index 1 using another thread, and so on. This approach allows for the computation of bitwise operations using up to 32 concurrent threads, corresponding to the 32-bit words used.Here is the implementation of the bitwise homomorphic XOR operation. The par_iter and par_iter_mut methods create a parallel iterator that we use to compute each XOR efficiently. The other two bitwise operations are implemented in the same way. let mut result = a.clone();
result.par_iter_mut()
.zip(a.par_iter().zip(b.par_iter()))
.for_each(|(dst, (lhs, rhs))| *dst = sk.xor(lhs, rhs));
result
}Addition modulo 2^32This might be the trickiest operation to efficiently implement in a homomorphic manner. A naive implementation could use the Ripple Carry Adder algorithm, which is straightforward but cannot be parallelized because each step depends on the previous one.A better choice is to use Carry Lookahead Adder, which allows us to use the parallelized AND and XOR bitwise operations. With this design, our adder is around 50% faster than the Ripple Carry Adder. let propagate = xor(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
let generate = and(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise AND
let carry = compute_carry(&propagate, &generate, sk);
let sum = xor(&propagate, &carry, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
sum
}
fn compute_carry(propagate: &[Ciphertext; 32], generate: &[Ciphertext; 32], sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut carry = trivial_bools(&[false; 32], sk);
carry[31] = sk.trivial_encrypt(false);
for i in (0..31).rev() {
carry[i] = sk.or(&generate[i + 1], &sk.and(&propagate[i + 1], &carry[i + 1]));
}
carry
}To further optimize performance, we use parallel prefix algorithms to parallelize the function that computes the carry signals. These algorithms involve more (homomorphic) boolean operations and their parallel nature speeds up the processing. We have implemented the Brent-Kung and Ladner-Fischer algorithms with different tradeoffs:Brent-Kung has the least amount of boolean operations we could find (140 when using grey cells, for 32-bit numbers), which makes it suitable when we can't process many operations concurrently and fast. Our results confirm that it's indeed faster than both the sequential algorithm and Ladner-Fischer when run on regular computers.On the other hand, Ladner-Fischer performs more boolean operations (209 using grey cells) than Brent-Kung, but they are performed in larger batches. Hence we can compute more operations in parallel and finish earlier, but we need more fast threads available or they will slow down the carry signals computation. Ladner-Fischer can be suitable when using cloud-based computing services, which offer many high-speed threads.Our implementation uses Brent-Kung by default, but you can enable Ladner-Fischer by using the --ladner-fischer command line argument.For more information about parallel prefix adders, you can read this paper or this other paper.Finally, with all these SHA-256 operations working homomorphically, our functions will be homomomorphic as well along with the whole SHA-256 function (after adapting the code to work with the Ciphertext type).More parallel processingLet's talk about other performance improvements we can make before we finish.In the main sha256_fhe, you can perform some functions in parallel. For example, in the compression loop, temp1 and temp2 can be computed in parallel by using the rayon::join() function when there is a CPU available. The two temporary values in the compression loop are the result of multiple additions, so you can use nested calls to rayon::join() to parallelize more operations.Another way to speed up consecutive additions would be using the Carry Save Adder, a very efficient adder that takes 3 numbers and returns a sum and a carry sequence. If our inputs are A, B, and C, we can construct a CSA with our previously implemented Maj function and the bitwise XOR operation as follows:Sum = A XOR B XOR CBy chaining CSAs, we can input the sum and carry from a preceding stage along with another number into a new CSA. Finally, to get the result of the additions we add the sum and carry sequences using a conventional adder. In the end, we are performing the same number of additions, but some of them are now CSAs, speeding up the process. Below is the illustration of this process in the temp1 and temp2 computations. || {
let ((sum, carry), s1) = rayon::join(
|| {
let ((sum, carry), ch) = rayon::join(
|| csa(&h, &w[i], &trivial_bools(&hex_to_bools(K[i]), sk), sk),
|| ch(&e, &f, &g, sk),
);
csa(&sum, &carry, &ch, sk)
},
|| sigma_upper_case_1(&e, sk)
);
let (sum, carry) = csa(&sum, &carry, &s1, sk);
add(&sum, &carry, sk)
},
|| {
add(&sigma_upper_case_0(&a, sk), &maj(&a, &b, &c, sk), sk)
},
);The first closure of the outer call to join will return temp1 and the second temp2.Inside the first outer closure, we call join recursively until we add the value h, the current word w[i], and the current constant K[i] by using the CSA, while potentially computing the ch function in parallel. Then we take the sum, carry, and ch values and add them again using the CSA.All this is done while potentially computing the sigma_upper_case_1 function. Finally we input the previous sum, carry, and sigma values to the CSA and perform the final addition with add. Once again, this is done while potentially computing sigma_upper_case_0 and maj and adding them to get temp2, in the second outer closure.With these types of changes, we finally get a homomorphic SHA256 function that doesn't leave unused computational resources.How to use SHA256_boolFirst, use the --release flag when running the program. Considering the implementation of encrypt_bools and decrypt_bools, the use of SHA-256 will be as follows: let matches = Command::new("Homomorphic sha256")
.arg(Arg::new("ladner_fischer")
.long("ladner-fischer")
.help("Use the Ladner Fischer parallel prefix algorithm for additions")
.action(ArgAction::SetTrue))
.get_matches();
// If set using the command line flag "--ladner-fischer" this algorithm will be used in additions
let ladner_fischer: bool = matches.get_flag("ladner_fischer");
// INTRODUCE INPUT FROM STDIN
let mut input = String::new();
println!("Write input to hash:");
io::stdin()
.read_line(&mut input)
.expect("Failed to read line");
input = input.trim_end_matches('\n').to_string();
println!("You entered: \"{}\"", input);
// CLIENT PADS DATA AND ENCRYPTS IT
let (ck, sk) = gen_keys();
let padded_input = pad_sha256_input(&input);
let encrypted_input = encrypt_bools(&padded_input, &ck);
// SERVER COMPUTES OVER THE ENCRYPTED PADDED DATA
println!("Computing the hash");
let encrypted_output = sha256_fhe(encrypted_input, ladner_fischer, &sk);
// CLIENT DECRYPTS THE OUTPUT
let output = decrypt_bools(&encrypted_output, &ck);
let outhex = bools_to_hex(output);
println!("{}", outhex);
}We can supply the data to hash using a file instead of the command line by using stdin . For example, if the file input.txt is in the same directory as the project, we can use the following shell command after building with cargo build --release:The program accepts hexadecimal inputs. The input must start with "0x" and contain only valid hex digits, otherwise it will be interpreted as text.Finally， padding is performed on the client side. This has the advantage of hiding the exact length of the input content from the server, thus avoiding the server extracting information from the length, even though the content is fully encrypted.It is also feasible to perform padding on the server side. The padding function would take the encrypted input and pad it with trivial bit encryptions. We can then integrate the padding function into the sha256_fhe function computed by the server.PreviousHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringNextAll tutorialsLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Initially, the file is minimal and doesn't contain any dependencies:name = "tfhe-example"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

tfhe = { version = "~1.1.3", features = ["integer"] }If you are on a different platform please refer to the installation documentation for configuration options of other supported platforms.Now that the project has TFHE-rs as a dependency here are the detailed steps to use its high-level API:Import the TFHE-rs prelude with the following Rust code: use tfhe::prelude::*;Client-side: configure and generate keysClient-side: encrypt dataServer-side: set the server keyServer-side: compute over encrypted dataClient-side: decrypt dataThis example demonstrates the basic workflow combining the client and server parts:use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;

let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);

# Security and cryptography | TFHE-rs

Security and cryptography | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSecurity and cryptographyThis document introduces the cryptographic concepts of the scheme of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) and the security considerations of TFHE-rs.TFHETFHE-rs is a cryptographic library that implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the TFHE scheme. You should understand the basics of TFHE to consider its limitations, such as:The precision: TFHE has limitations on the number of bits used to represent plaintext values.The execution time: TFHE operations are slower than native operations due to their complexity.LWE ciphertextsTFHE-rs primarily utilizes Learning With Errors (LWE) ciphertexts. The LWE problem forms the basis of TFHE's security and is considered resistant to quantum attacks.An LWE Ciphertext is a collection of 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integers. Before encrypting a message in an LWE ciphertext, you first need to encode it as a plaintext by shifting the message to the most significant bits of the unsigned integer type used.Then, you add a small random value called noise to the least significant bits. This noise is crucial in ensuring the security of the ciphertext.plaintext=(Δ∗m)+eplaintext = (\Delta * m) + eplaintext=(Δ∗m)+em∈Zpm \in \mathbb{Z}_pm∈Zp​To get a ciphertext from a plaintext, you must encrypt the plaintext using a secret key.An LWE secret key is a list of n random integers: S=(s0,...,sn−1)S = (s_0, ..., s_{n-1})S=(s0​,...,sn−1​). nnn is called the LweDimensionLweDimensionLweDimensionAn LWE ciphertext is composed of two parts:The mask (a0,...,an−1)(a_0, ..., a_{n-1})(a0​,...,an−1​)The body bbbThe mask of a fresh ciphertext (the result of an encryption, and not the result of operations such as ciphertext addition) is a list of n uniformly random values.The body is computed as follows:b=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintextb = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintextb=(∑i=0n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintextNow that the encryption scheme is defined, let's review the example of the addition between ciphertexts to illustrate why it is slower to compute over encrypted data.To add two ciphertexts, we must add their maskmaskmask and bodybodybody:ct0=(a0,...,an−1,b)ct1=(a0′,...,an−1′,b′)ct2=ct0+ct1ct2=(a0+a0′,...,an−1+an−1′,b+b′)b+b′=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintext+(∑i=0n−1ai′∗si)+plaintext′b+b′=(∑i=0n−1(ai+ai′)∗si)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′ct_0 = (a_{0}, ..., a_{n-1}, b) \\ ct_1 = (a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b^{\prime}) \\ ct_{2} = ct_0 + ct_1 \\ ct_{2} = (a_{0} + a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1} + a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b + b^{\prime})\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintext + (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i^{\prime} * s_i}) + plaintext^{\prime}\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{(a_i + a_i^{\prime})* s_i}) + \Delta m + \Delta m^{\prime} + e + e^{\prime}\\ct0​=(a0​,...,an−1​,b)ct1​=(a0′​,...,an−1′​,b′)ct2​=ct0​+ct1​ct2​=(a0​+a0′​,...,an−1​+an−1′​,b+b′)b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintext+(i=0∑n−1​ai′​∗si​)+plaintext′b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​(ai​+ai′​)∗si​)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′To add ciphertexts, it is necessary to add both their masks and bodies. The operation involves adding n+1n + 1n+1 elements, rather than just adding two integers. This is an intuitive example to show how FHE computation is slower compared to plaintext computation. However, other operations are far more expensive (for example, the computation of a lookup table using Programmable Bootstrapping).Programmable Bootstrapping, noise management, and carry bitsIn FHE, two types of operations can be applied to ciphertexts:Leveled operations, which increase the noise in the ciphertextBootstrapped operations, which reduce the noise in the ciphertextNoise is critical in FHE because it can tamper with the message if not tracked and managed properly. Bootstrapping operations decrease noise within the ciphertexts and guarantee the correctness of computation. The rest of the operations do not need bootstrapping operations, thus they are called leveled operations and are usually very fast as a result.The following sections explain the concept of noise and padding in ciphertexts.NoiseTo ensure security, LWE requires random noise to be added to the message during encryption.TFHE scheme draws this random noise either from:A Centered Normal Distribution with a standard deviation parameter. The choice of standard deviation impacts the security level: increasing the standard deviation enhances security while keeping other factors constant.A Tweaked Uniform (TUniform) Distribution with a bound parameter 2b2^b2b defined as follows: any value in the interval (−2b,...,2b)(−2^b, ... , 2^b)(−2b,...,2b) is selected with probability 1/2b+11/2^{b+1}1/2b+1, with the two end points −2b−2^b−2b and 2b2^b2b being selected with probability 1/2b+21/2^{b+2}1/2b+2. The main advantage of this distribution is to be bounded, whereas the usual Central Normal Distribution one is not. In some practical cases, this can simplify the use of homomorphic computation. The choice of the bound impacts the security level: increasing the bound enhances security while keeping other factors constant.TFHE-rs encodes the noise in the least significant bits of each plaintext. Each leveled computation increases the value of the noise. If too many computations are performed, the noise will eventually overflow into the message bits and lead to an incorrect result.The following figure illustrates how the extra bit of noise is incurred during an addition operation.Noise overtaking the plaintexts after homomorphic addition. Most significant bits are on the left.TFHE-rs enables automatic noise management by performing bootstrapping operations to reset the noise.Programmable BootStrapping (PBS)The bootstrapping of TFHE is programmable. This allows any function to be homomorphically computed over an encrypted input, while also reducing the noise. These functions are represented by look-up tables.In general, the computation of a PBS is preceded or followed by a keyswitch, an operation to change the encryption key. The output ciphertext is then encrypted with the same key as the input one. To do this, two (public) evaluation keys are required: a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key.These operations are quite complex to describe in short, you can find more details about these operations (or about TFHE in general) in the TFHE Deep Dive.CarrySince encoded values have a fixed precision, operating on them can produce results that are outside of the original interval. To avoid losing precision or wrapping around the interval, TFHE-rs uses additional bits by defining bits of padding on the most significant bits.For example, when adding two ciphertexts, the sum could exceed the range of either ciphertext, and thus necessitate a carry that would then be transferred onto the first padding bit. In the following figure, each plaintext over 32 bits has one bit of padding on its left (the most significant bit). After the addition, the padding bit gets consumed to accommodate the carry. We refer to this process as consuming bits of padding. Without any padding-left, further additions may not produce accurate results.SecurityBy default, the cryptographic parameters provided by TFHE-rs ensure at least 128 bits of security. The security has been evaluated using the latest versions of the Lattice Estimator (repository) with red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16.For the High-Level API the default parameters are selected with a bootstrapping failure probability (or error probability) fixed at perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 for the x86 CPU backend, and perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64 for the GPU backend.
A failure probability below 2−1282^{-128}2−128 ensures that our implementation is resilient against attacks in the IND-CPA-D model [1]. In the case where only the IND-CPA model is considered, there is a possibility to choose parameters with a perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64, see the dedicated Parameters section[1] Li, Baiyu, et al. "Securing approximate homomorphic encryption using differential privacy." Annual International Cryptology Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022.The parameter sets for the x86 CPU backend with a perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 are obtained using the drift mitigation technique described in [2].[2]Bernard, Olivier, et al. "Drifting Towards Better Error Probabilities in Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes".Classical public key encryption.In classical public key encryption, the public key contains a given number of ciphertexts all encrypting the value 0. By setting the number of encryptions to 0 in the public key at m=⌈(n+1)log⁡(q)⌉+λm = \lceil (n+1) \log(q) \rceil + \lambdam=⌈(n+1)log(q)⌉+λ, where nnn is the LWE dimension, qqq is the ciphertext modulus, and λ\lambdaλ is the number of security bits. This construction is secure due to the leftover hash lemma, which relates to the impossibility of breaking the underlying multiple subset sum problem. This guarantees both a high-density subset sum and an exponentially large number of possible associated random vectors per LWE sample (a,b)(a,b)(a,b).PreviousZero-knowledge proof benchmarksNextTypesLast updated 6 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore crypto APIQuick startThe core_crypto module from TFHE-rs is dedicated to the implementation of the cryptographic tools related to TFHE. To construct an FHE application, the shortint and/or Boolean modules (based on core_crypto) are recommended.The core_crypto module offers an API to low-level cryptographic primitives and objects, like lwe_encryption or rlwe_ciphertext. The goal is to propose an easy-to-use API for cryptographers.The overall code architecture is split in two parts: one for entity definitions and another focused on algorithms. The entities contain the definition of useful types, like LWE ciphertext or bootstrapping keys. The algorithms are then naturally defined to work using these entities.The API is convenient to add or modify existing algorithms, or to have direct access to the raw data. Even if the LWE ciphertext object is defined, along with functions giving access to the body, it is also possible to bypass these to get directly the ithi^{th}ith element of LWE mask.For instance, the code to encrypt and then decrypt a message looks like: tfhe::core_crypto::prelude::*;
// DISCLAIMER: these toy example parameters are not guaranteed to be secure or yield correct
// computations
// Define parameters for LweCiphertext creation
let lwe_dimension = LweDimension(742);

# Boolean | TFHE-rs

Boolean | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanIn tfhe::boolean, the available operations are mainly related to their equivalent Boolean gates (i.e., AND, OR... etc). What follows are examples of a unary gate (NOT) and a binary gate (XOR). The last one is about the ternary MUX gate, which allows homomorphic computation of conditional statements of the form If..Then..Else.This library is meant to be used both on the server side and the client side. The typical use case should follow the subsequent steps:On the client side, generate the client and server keys.Send the server key to the server.Then any number of times:On the client side, encrypt the input data with the client key.Transmit the encrypted input to the server.On the server side, perform homomorphic computation with the server key.Transmit the encrypted output to the client.On the client side, decrypt the output data with the client key.SetupIn the first step, the client creates two keys, the client key and the server key, with the tfhe::boolean::gen_keys function: tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate the client key and the server key,
// using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key): (ClientKey, ServerKey) = gen_keys();
}The client_key is of type ClientKey. It is secret and must never be transmitted. This key will only be used to encrypt and decrypt data.The server_key is of type ServerKey. It is a public key and can be shared with any party. This key has to be sent to the server because it is required for homomorphic computation.Note that both the client_key and server_key implement the Serialize and Deserialize traits. This way you can use any compatible serializer to store/send the data. To store the server_key in a binary file, you can use the bincode library:use std::io::{Write, Read};
use tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE ----------------------------
// We generate a client key and a server key, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
// We serialize the server key to bytes, and store them in a file:
let encoded: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&server_key).unwrap();
// Create a tmp dir with the current user name to avoid cluttering the /tmp dir
let user = std::env::var("USER").unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_user".to_string());
let tmp_dir_for_user = &format!("/tmp/{user}");
create_dir_all(tmp_dir_for_user).unwrap();
let server_key_file = &format!("{tmp_dir_for_user}/tutorial_server_key.bin");
// We write the server key to a file:
let mut file = File::create(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to create server key file");
file.write_all(encoded.as_slice()).expect("failed to write key to file");
// ...
// We send the key to server side
// ...
//---------------------------- SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We read the file:
let mut file = File::open(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to open server key file");
let mut encoded: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
file.read_to_end(&mut encoded).expect("failed to read key");
// We deserialize the server key:
let key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize(&encoded[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
}Encrypting inputsOnce the server key is available on the server side, it is possible to perform some homomorphic computations. The client needs to encrypt some data and send it to the server. Again, the Ciphertext type implements the Serialize and the Deserialize traits, so that any serializer and communication tool suiting your use case can be employed:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE
// We use the client key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts:
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server somehow
// ...
}Encrypting inputs using a public keyAnyone (the server or a third party) with the public key can also encrypt some (or all) of the inputs. The public key can only be used to encrypt, not to decrypt.
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//---------------------------- SERVER or THIRD_PARTY SIDE
// We use the public key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts (if not on the server already):
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server to be deserialized (if not on the server already)
// ...
}Executing a Boolean circuitOnce the encrypted inputs are on the server side, the server_key can be used to homomorphically execute the desired Boolean circuit:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We deserialize the ciphertexts:
let ct_1: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_1[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
let ct_2: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_2[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// We use the server key to execute the boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);
// Then we serialize the output of the circuit:
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6)
.expect("failed to serialize output");
// ...
// And we send the output to the client
// ...
}Decrypting the outputOnce the encrypted output is on the client side, the client_key can be used to decrypt it:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_6 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON CLIENT SIDE
// We deserialize the output ciphertext:
let output: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_output[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// Finally, we decrypt the output:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&output);
// And check that the result is the expected one:
assert!(output);

# Integer | TFHE-rs

Integer | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegertfhe::integer is dedicated to integers smaller than 256 bits. The steps to homomorphically evaluate an integer circuit are described here.Key Typesinteger provides 3 basic key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages, thus this key is meant to be kept private and should never be shared. This key is created from parameter values that will dictate both the security and efficiency of computations. The parameters also set the maximum number of bits of message encrypted in a ciphertext.The ServerKey is the key that is used to actually do the FHE computations. It contains a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key. This key is created from a ClientKey that needs to be shared to the server, so it is not meant to be kept private. A user with a ServerKey can compute on the encrypted data sent by the owner of the associated ClientKey.To reflect this, computation/operation methods are tied to the ServerKey type.The PublicKey is a key used to encrypt messages. It can be publicly shared to allow users to encrypt data such that only the ClientKey holder will be able to decrypt. Encrypting with the PublicKey does not alter the homomorphic capabilities associated to the ServerKey.1. Key GenerationTo generate the keys, a user needs two parameters:A set of shortint cryptographic parameters.The number of ciphertexts used to encrypt an integer (we call them "shortint blocks").We are now going to build a pair of keys that can encrypt 8-bit integers (signed or unsigned) by using 4 shortint blocks that store 2 bits of message each.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}2. Encrypting valuesOnce we have our keys, we can encrypt values:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}3. Encrypting values with the public keyOnce the client key is generated, the public key can be derived and used to encrypt data.use tfhe::integer::PublicKey;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
//We generate the public key from the secret client key:
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//encryption
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the public key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg1, num_block);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg2, num_block);
}4. Computing and decryptingWith our server_key, and encrypted values, we can now do an addition and then decrypt the result.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128;
let msg2 = 13;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.add_parallelized(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsQuick startThis library makes it possible to execute homomorphic operations over encrypted data, where the data are either Booleans, short integers (named shortint in the rest of this documentation), or integers up to 256 bits. It allows you to execute a circuit on an untrusted server because both circuit inputs and outputs are kept private. Data are indeed encrypted on the client side, before being sent to the server. On the server side, every computation is performed on ciphertexts.The server, however, has to know the circuit to be evaluated. At the end of the computation, the server returns the encryption of the result to the user. Then the user can decrypt it with the secret key.General method to write an homomorphic circuit programThe overall process to write an homomorphic program is the same for all types. The basic steps for using the TFHE-rs library are the following:Choose a data type (Boolean, shortint, integer)Import the libraryCreate client and server keysEncrypt data with the client keyCompute over encrypted data using the server keyDecrypt data with the client keyAPI levels.This library has different modules, with different levels of abstraction.There is the core_crypto module, which is the lowest level API with the primitive functions and types of the TFHE scheme.Above the core_crypto module, there are the Boolean, shortint, and integer modules, which contain easy to use APIs enabling evaluation of Boolean, short integer, and integer circuits.Finally, there is the high-level module built on top of the Boolean, shortint, integer modules. This module is meant to abstract cryptographic complexities: no cryptographical knowledge is required to start developing an FHE application. Another benefit of the high-level module is the drastically simplified development process compared to lower level modules.high-level APITFHE-rs exposes a high-level API by default that includes datatypes that try to match Rust's native types by having overloaded operators (+, -, ...).Here is an example of how the high-level API is used:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()

let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);

let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintOperationsThe structure and operations related to short integers are described in this section.How a shortint is representedIn shortint, the encrypted data is stored in an LWE ciphertext.Conceptually, the message stored in an LWE ciphertext is divided into a carry buffer and a message buffer.The message buffer is the space where the actual message is stored. This represents the modulus of the input messages (denoted by MessageModulus in the code). When doing computations on a ciphertext, the encrypted message can overflow the message modulus. The part of the message which exceeds the message modulus is stored in the carry buffer. The size of the carry buffer is defined by another modulus, called CarryModulus.Together, the message modulus and the carry modulus form the plaintext space that is available in a ciphertext. This space cannot be overflowed, otherwise the computation may result in an incorrect output.In order to ensure the correctness of the computation, we track the maximum value encrypted in a ciphertext via an associated attribute called the degree. When the degree reaches a defined threshold, the carry buffer may be emptied to safely resume the computations. In shortint the carry modulus is considered useful as a means to do more computations.Types of operationsThe operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted valuesscalar operations that take at least one non-encrypted value as inputFor example, the addition has two variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (a so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space. Using this operation might have an impact on the correctness of the following operations;checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely;smart: always does the operation. If the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will clear the carry to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is to allow the modification of the carry, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value;default: always does the operation and always clears the carry. Could be slower than smart, but it ensures that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use operation typesLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of operations that we have already introduced. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavour may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise,checked and smart are the best options.Let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and a multiplication.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
println!("expected {}, found {}", ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus, output);
}During this computation, the carry buffer has been overflowed and, as all the operations were unchecked, the output may be incorrect.If we redo this same circuit with the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use std::error::Error;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ops = || -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
server_key.checked_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar)?;
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2)?;
server_key.checked_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2)?;
Ok(())
};
match ops() {
Ok(_) => (),
Err(e) => {
println!("correctness of operations is not guaranteed due to error: {e}");
return;
},
}
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be cleaned during the computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);

let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);

server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings as long as this is the only kind of operation which is used.Using default could slow-down computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}#List of available operationsCertain operations can only be used if the parameter set chosen is compatible with the bivariate programmable bootstrapping, meaning the carry buffer is larger than or equal to the message buffer. These operations are marked with a star (*).The list of implemented operations for shortint is:addition between two ciphertextsaddition between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalarcomparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalardivision of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarLSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the result truncated to fit in the message buffermultiplication of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarbitwise shift <<, >>subtraction of a ciphertext by another ciphertextsubtraction of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarnegation of a ciphertextbitwise and, or and xor (*)comparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between two ciphertexts (*)division between two ciphertexts (*)MSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the part overflowing the message buffer (*)Public key encryption.TFHE-rs supports both private and public key encryption methods. The only difference between both lies in the encryption step: in this case, the encryption method is called using public_key instead of client_key.Here is a small example on how to use public encryption:
fn main() {
// Generate the client key and the server key:
let (cks, _) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let pks = PublicKey::new(&cks);
let msg = 2;
// Encryption of one message:
let ct = pks.encrypt(msg);
// Decryption:
let dec = cks.decrypt(&ct);
assert_eq!(dec, msg);
}Arithmetic operations.Classical arithmetic operations are supported by shortint:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_add(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 + msg2) % modulus);
}bitwise operationsShort homomorphic integer types support some bitwise operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to homomorphically compute a bitwise AND:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_bitand(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 & msg2) % modulus);
}comparisonsShort homomorphic integer types support comparison operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_greater_or_equal(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 >= msg2) as u64 % modulus);
}univariate function evaluationsA simple example on how to use this operation to homomorphically compute the hamming weight (i.e., the number of bits equal to one) of an encrypted number.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
// We use the private client key to encrypt a message:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
// Compute the lookup table for the univariate function:
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table(|n| n.count_ones().into());
// Apply the table lookup on the input message:
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table(&ct_1, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, msg1.count_ones() as u64);
}bi-variate function evaluationsUsing the shortint types offers the possibility to evaluate bi-variate functions, or functions that take two ciphertexts as input. This requires choosing a parameter set such that the carry buffer size is at least as large as the message (i.e., PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with X <= Y).Here is a simple code example:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// Compute the lookup table for the bivariate functions
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table_bivariate(|x,y| (x.count_ones()
+ y.count_ones()) as u64 % modulus );
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table_bivariate(&ct_1, &ct_2, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1.count_ones() as u64 + msg2.count_ones() as u64) % modulus);

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintCryptographic parametersAll parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator. Default parameters have an error probability equal to 2−1282^{-128}2−128 when using programmable bootstrapping. This error probability is due to the randomness added at each encryption (see here for more details about the encryption process).Parameters and message precisionshortint comes with sets of parameters that permit the use of the library functionalities securely and efficiently. Each parameter set is associated to the message and carry precisions. Therefore, each key pair is entangled to precision.The user is allowed to choose which set of parameters to use when creating the pair of keys.The difference between the parameter sets is the total amount of space dedicated to the plaintext, how it is split between the message buffer and the carry buffer, and the order in which the keyswitch (KS) and bootstrap (PBS) are computed. The syntax chosen for the name of a parameter is: PARAM_MESSAGE_{number of message bits}_CARRY_{number of carry bits}_{KS_PBS | PBS_KS}. For example, the set of parameters for a message buffer of 5 bits, a carry buffer of 2 bits and where the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrap is PARAM_MESSAGE_5_CARRY_2_KS_PBS.Note that the KS_PBS order should have better performance at the expense of ciphertext size, PBS_KS is the opposite.This example contains keys that are generated to have messages encoded over 2 bits (i.e., computations are done modulus 22=42^2 = 422=4) with 2 bits of carry.The PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameter set is the default shortint parameter set that you can also use through the tfhe::shortint::prelude::DEFAULT_PARAMETERS constant. tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Impact of parameters on the operationsAs shown here, the choice of the parameter set impacts the operations available and their efficiency.Generic bi-variate functions.The computations of bi-variate functions is based on a trick: concatenating two ciphertexts into one. Where the carry buffer is not at least as large as the message buffer, this trick no longer works. In this case, many bi-variate operations, such as comparisons, cannot be correctly computed. The only exception concerns multiplication.Multiplication.In the case of multiplication, two algorithms are implemented: the first one relies on the bi-variate function trick, where the other one is based on the quarter square method. To correctly compute a multiplication, the only requirement is to have at least one bit of carry (i.e., using parameter sets PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with Y>=1). This method is slower than using the other one. Using the smart version of the multiplication automatically chooses which algorithm is used depending on the chosen parameters.User-defined parameter setsIt is possible to define new parameter sets. To do so, it is sufficient to use the function new() or to manually fill the ClassicPBSParameters structure fields.For instance:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{DynamicDistribution, ModulusSwitchType};
fn main() {
// WARNING: might be insecure and/or incorrect
// You can create your own set of parameters
let param = ClassicPBSParameters {

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanCryptographic parametersDefault parametersThe TFHE cryptographic scheme relies on a variant of Regev cryptosystem and is based on a problem so difficult that it is even post-quantum resistant.Some cryptographic parameters will require tuning to ensure both the correctness of the result and the security of the computation.To make it simpler, we've provided two sets of parameters, which ensure correct computations for a certain probability with the standard security of 128 bits. There exists an error probability due to the probabilistic nature of the encryption, which requires adding randomness (noise) following a Gaussian distribution. If this noise is too large, the decryption will not give a correct result. There is a trade-off between efficiency and correctness: generally, using a less efficient parameter set (in terms of computation time) leads to a smaller risk of having an error during homomorphic evaluation.In the two proposed sets of parameters, the only difference lies in this error probability. The default parameter set ensures an error probability of at most 2−642^{-64}2−64 when computing a programmable bootstrapping (i.e., any gates but the not). The other one is closer to the error probability claimed in the original TFHE paper, namely 2−1652^{-165}2−165, but it is up-to-date regarding security requirements.The following array summarizes this:DEFAULT_PARAMETERS2−642^{-64}2−64TFHE_LIB_PARAMETERS2−1652^{-165}2−165User-defined parametersYou can also create your own set of parameters.

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerOperationsThe structure and operations related to integers are described in this section.How an integer is representedIn integer, the encrypted data is split amongst many ciphertexts encrypted with the shortint library. Below is a scheme representing an integer composed by k shortint ciphertexts.This crate implements two ways to represent an integer:the Radix representationthe CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) representationRadix-based integers.The first possibility to represent a large integer is to use a Radix-based decomposition on the plaintexts. Let B∈NB \in \mathbb{N}B∈N be a basis such that the size of BBB is smaller than (or equal to) 4 bits. Then, an integer m∈Nm \in \mathbb{N}m∈N can be written as m=m0+m1∗B+m2∗B2+...m = m_0 + m_1*B + m_2*B^2 + ...m=m0​+m1​∗B+m2​∗B2+..., where each mim_imi​ is strictly smaller than BBB. Each mim_imi​ is then independently encrypted. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.The definition of an integer requires a basis and a number of blocks. These parameters are chosen at key generation. Below, the keys are dedicated to integers encrypting messages over 8 bits, using a basis over 2 bits (i.e., B=22B=2^2B=22) and 4 blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}In this representation, the correctness of operations requires the carries to be propagated throughout the ciphertext. This operation is costly, since it relies on the computation of many programmable bootstrapping operations over shortints.CRT-based integers.The second approach to represent large integers is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this case, the basis BBB is composed of several integers bib_ibi​, such that there are pairwise coprime, and each b_ib\_ib_i has a size smaller than 4 bits. The CRT-based integer are defined modulus ∏bi\prod b_i∏bi​. For an integer mmm, its CRT decomposition is simply defined as m mod b0,m mod b1,...m \bmod{b_0}, m \bmod{b_1}, ...mmodb0​,mmodb1​,.... Each part is then encrypted as a shortint ciphertext. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.In the following example, the chosen basis is B=[2,3,5]B = [2, 3, 5]B=[2,3,5]. The integer is defined modulus 2∗3∗5=302*3*5 = 302∗3∗5=30. There is no need to pre-size the number of blocks since it is determined from the number of values composing the basis. Here, the integer is split over three blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let basis = vec![2, 3, 5];
let cks = CrtClientKey::new(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, basis);
}This representation has many advantages: no carry propagation is required, cleaning the carry buffer of each ciphertext block is enough. This implies that operations can easily be parallelized. It also allows the efficient computation of PBS in the case where the function is CRT-compliant.A variant of the CRT is proposed where each block might be associated to a different key couple. Here, a keychain to the computations is required, but this may result in a performance improvement.List of available operationsThe list of operations available in integer depends on the type of representation:Negation✔️✔️Addition✔️✔️Scalar Addition✔️✔️Subtraction✔️✔️Scalar Subtraction✔️✔️Multiplication✔️✔️Scalar Multiplication✔️✔️Bitwise OR, AND, XOR✔️✔️Equality✔️✔️Left/Right Shift✔️✖️Comparisons <,<=,>, >=✔️✖️Min, Max✔️✖️Types of operationsMuch like shortint, the operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted values.scalar operations take at least one non-encrypted value as input.For example, the addition has both variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (the so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space.checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely.smart: always does the operation, if the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will propagate the carry buffer to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is because the inputs' carry might be cleaned, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value.default: always compute the operation and always clear the carry. Could be slower than smart, but ensure that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use each operation typeLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of already introduced operations. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavor may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise, checked and smart are the best options.As an example, let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and an addition.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
// The carry buffer has been overflowed, the result is not correct
assert_ne!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}During this computation the carry buffer has been overflowed, and the output may be incorrect as all the operations were unchecked.If the same circuit is done but using the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 2;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.checked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar).unwrap();
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2).unwrap();
let result = server_key.checked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
assert!(result.is_err());
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
// Only the scalar multiplication could be done
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar) - msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits the manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be propagated during the computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.smart_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}You must avoid cloning the inputs when calling smart operations to preserve performance. For instance, you SHOULD NOT have these kind of patterns in the code:The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings, as long as only this kind of operation is used. Only the parallelized version of the operations is provided.Using default could slow down computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);

Serialization/Deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerSerialization/DeserializationAs explained in the introduction, some types (Serverkey, Ciphertext) are meant to be shared with the server that does the computations.The easiest way to send these data to a server is to use the serialization and deserialization features. TFHE-rs uses the serde framework, so serde's Serialize and Deserialize are implemented.To be able to serialize our data, a data format needs to be picked. Here, bincode is a good choice, mainly because it is binary format.

# Debugging | TFHE-rs

Debugging | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingDebuggingThis document explains a feature to facilitate debugging.Starting from TFHE-rs 0.5, trivial ciphertexts introduce a new feature to facilitate debugging. This feature supports a debugger, print statements, and faster execution, significantly reducing waiting time and enhancing the development pace of FHE applications.Trivial ciphertexts are not secure. An application released/deployed in production must never receive trivial ciphertext from a client.To use this feature, simply call your circuits/functions with trivially encrypted values that are created using encrypt_trivial(instead of real encryptions that are created using encrypt): tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{set_server_key, generate_keys, ConfigBuilder, FheUint128};
fn mul_all(a: &FheUint128, b: &FheUint128, c: &FheUint128) -> FheUint128 {
// Use the debug format ('{:?}'), if you don't want to unwrap()
// and panic if the value is not a trivial.
println!(
"a: {:?}, b: {:?}, c: {:?}",
a.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
b.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
c.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
);
let tmp = a * b;
println!("a * b = {:?}", tmp.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>());
tmp * c
}
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default().build());
set_server_key(sks);
let a = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(1234u128);
let b = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(4567u128);
let c = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(89101112u128);
// since all inputs are trivially encrypted, this is going to be
// much faster
let result = mul_all(&a, &b, &c);
}This example is going to print:a * b = Ok(5635678)If any input to mul_all is not a trivial ciphertexts, the computations will be done 100% in FHE, and the program will output:a * b = Err(NotTrivialCiphertextError)Using trivial encryptions as input, the example runs in 980 ms on a standard 12-core laptop, compared to 7.5 seconds on a 128-core machine using real encryptions.PreviousGeneric trait boundsNextGPU accelerationLast updated 2 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# PBS statistics | TFHE-rs

PBS statistics | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingPBS statisticsThis document explains how to use the PBS statistics feature in TFHE-rs' shortint API to assess the overall computational intensity in FHE applications.The shortint API now includes a global counter to track the number of Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) executed with the pbs-stats feature. This feature enables precise tracking of PBS executions in a circuit. It helps to estimate the overall compute intensity of FHE code using either the shortint, integer, or High-Level APIs.To know how many PBSes were executed, call get_pbs_count. To reset the PBS count, call reset_pbs_count. You can combine two functions to understand how many PBSes were executed in each part of your code.When combined with the debug mode, this feature allows for quick estimations during iterations on the FHE code.Here is an example of how to use the PBS counter: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::*;
pub fn main() {
// Config and key generation
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Encryption
let a = FheUint32::encrypt(42u32, &cks);
let b = FheUint32::encrypt(16u32, &cks);
// Set the server key
set_server_key(sks);
// Compute and get the PBS count for the 32 bits multiplication
let c = &a * &b;
let mul_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Reset the PBS count, and get the PBS count for a 32 bits bitwise AND
reset_pbs_count();
let d = &a & &b;
let and_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Display the result
println!("mul_32_count: {mul_32_count}");
println!("and_32_count: {and_32_count}");

# Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rs

Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingGeneric trait boundsThis document serves as a practical reference for implementing generic functions in Rust that use operators across mixed references and values. The following explanations help you to understand the trait bounds necessary to handle such operations.Operators such as +, *, >>, and so on are tied to traits in std:::ops. For instance, the + operator corresponds to std::ops::Add. When writing a generic function that uses the + operator, you need to specify std::ops::Add as a trait bound.The trait bound varies slightly depending on whether the left-hand side / right-hand side is an owned value or a reference. The following table shows the different scenarios:T $op TT: $Op<T, Output=T>T $op &TT: for<'a> $Op<&'a T, Output=T>&T $op Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<T, Output=T>&T $op &Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<&'a T, Output=T>The for<'a> syntax refers to the Higher-Rank Trait Bounds(HRTB).Using generic functions allows for clearer input handling, which simplifies the debugging.Example std::ops::{Add, Mul};

# KVStore | TFHE-rs

KVStore | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageTypesKVStoreThis document describes the KVStore type provided by the High-level API.The KVStore is a storage type that associates keys to values, similar to a hash table. In the KVStore, the keys are clear numbers, and values are encrypted numbers such as FheUint or FheInt.Clear-key operationsThe KVStore supports operations where the queried key is clear. These operations are inexpensive and efficient to perform.insert_with_clear_key - insert or replace a key-value pairupdate_with_clear_key - update the value associated to an existing keyremove_with_clear_key - remove an existing key-value pairget_with_clear_key - get the value associated to a keyEncrypted-key operationsThe KVStore also supports doing queries using an encrypted key.get - get the value associated to a keyupdate - update the value associated to an already existing keymap - update the value associated to an already existing key, by computing a function on it. This is faster than doing get, then update.Encrypted-key operations do not support inserting or removing key-value pairs.SerializationTo serialize a KVStore, it must first be compressed.

Strings | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageTypesStringsThis document explains the FheAsciiString type for handling encrypted strings in TFHE-rs.TFHE-rs has supports for ASCII strings with the type FheAsciiString. You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=stringsStrings are not yet compatible with CompactCiphertextList and CompressedCiphertextListSupported OperationsA variety of common operations are supported for FheAsciiString. These include:Comparisons: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, eq_ignore_caseCase conversion: to_lowercase / to_uppercaseString checks: starts_with / ends_with / containsTrimming: trim_start / trim_end / trimPrefix/suffix operations: strip_prefix / strip_suffixSearch: find / rfindWhen encrypting strings, you can add padding to hide the actual length of strings. The null character (b'\0') is used as the padding. Here is an example:

let padded_string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt_with_padding("tfhe-rs", 3, &cks).unwrap();
// This makes it so the string has 10 chars (adds padding or truncates input as necessary)
let other_string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt_with_fixed_sized("tfhe", 10, &cks).unwrap();
let mut buffer1 = vec![];

# Parameters | TFHE-rs

Parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore workflowParametersThis document explains how the choice of cryptographic parameters impacts both the security and efficiency of FHE algorithms. The chosen parameters determine the error probability (sometimes referred to failure probability) and overall performance of computations using fully homomorphic encryption. This error probability is due to the noisy nature of FHE computations (see here for more details about the encryption process).All parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator.Default parametersCurrently, the default parameters use blocks that contain 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry - a tweaked uniform (TUniform, defined here) noise distribution, and have a bootstrapping failure probability perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128. These are particularly suitable for applications that need to be secure in the IND-CPA^D model (see here for more details).When using the high-level API of TFHE-rs, you can create a key pair using the default recommended set of parameters. For example: tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations
}These default parameters may be updated with in future releases of TFHE-rs, potentially causing incompatibilities between versions. For production systems, it is therefore recommended to specify a fixed parameter set.Parameters versioning and naming schemeParameter sets are versioned for backward compatibility. This means that each set of parameters can be tied to a specific version of TFHE-rs, so that they remain unchanged and compatible after an upgrade.All parameter sets are stored as variables inside the tfhe::shortint::parameters module, with submodules named after the versions of TFHE-rs in which these parameters where added. For example, parameters added in TFHE-rs v1.0 can be found inside tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_0.The naming convention of these parameters indicates their capabilities. Taking tfhe::parameters::v1_0::V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128 as an example:V1_0: these parameters were introduced in TFHE-rs v1.0MESSAGE_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of messageCARRY_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of carryKS_PBS: the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrapTUNIFORM: the tweaked uniform noise distribution is used2M128: the probability of failure for the bootstrap is 2−1282^{-128}2−128For convenience, aliases are provided for the most used sets of parameters and stored in the module tfhe::shortint::parameters::aliases. Note, however, that these parameters are not stable over time and are always updated to the latest TFHE-rs version. For this reason, they should only be used for prototyping and are not suitable for production use cases.How to choose the parameter setsYou can override the default parameters with the with_custom_parameters(block_parameters) method of the Config object. For example, to use a Gaussian distribution instead of the TUniform one, you can modify your configuration as follows:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::current_params::V1_4_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
fn main() {
let config =
ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(V1_4_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128)
.build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations

# Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rs

Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingCompressing ciphertexts/keysThis document explains the mechanism and steps to compress ciphertext and keys to reduce the storage needed as well as transmission times.Most TFHE-rs entities contain random numbers generated by a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). Since the implemented PRNG is deterministic, storing only the random seed used to generate those numbers preserves all necessary information. When decompressing the entity, using the same PRNG and the same seed will reconstruct the full chain of random values.In TFHE-rs, compressible entities are prefixed with Compressed. For instance, a compressed FheUint256 is declared as CompressedFheUint256.In the following example code, we use the bincode crate dependency to serialize in a binary format and compare serialized sizes.Compressing CiphertextsCompressing ciphertexts at encryption timeThis example shows how to compress a ciphertext encrypting messages over 16 bits: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, CompressedFheUint16};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let clear = 12_837u16;
let compressed = CompressedFheUint16::try_encrypt(clear, &client_key).unwrap();
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed).unwrap().len()
);
let decompressed = compressed.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&decompressed).unwrap().len()
);
let clear_decompressed: u16 = decompressed.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear_decompressed, clear);
}Compression ciphertexts after some homomorphic computationYou can compress ciphertexts at any time, even after performing multiple homomorphic operations.To do so, you need to build a list containing all the ciphertexts that have to be compressed. This list might contain ciphertexts of different types, e.g., FheBool, FheUint32, FheInt64,... There is no constraint regarding the size of the list.There are two possible approaches:Single list: Compressing several ciphertexts into a single list. This generally yields a better compression ratio between output and input sizes;Multiple lists: Using multiple lists. This offers more flexibility, since compression might happen at different times in the code, but could lead to larger outputs.In more details, the optimal ratio is achieved with a list whose size is equal to the lwe_per_glwe field from the CompressionParameters.The following example shows how to compress and decompress a list containing 4 messages: one 32-bits integer, one 64-bit integer, one boolean, and one 2-bit integer.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2,
};
use tfhe::{
set_server_key, CompressedCiphertextList, CompressedCiphertextListBuilder, FheBool,
FheInt64, FheUint16, FheUint2, FheUint32,
};
fn main() {
let config =
tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.enable_compression(COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.build();
let ck = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let sk = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&ck);
set_server_key(sk);
let ct1 = FheUint32::encrypt(17_u32, &ck);
let ct2 = FheInt64::encrypt(-1i64, &ck);
let ct3 = FheBool::encrypt(false, &ck);
let ct4 = FheUint2::encrypt(3u8, &ck);
let compressed_list = CompressedCiphertextListBuilder::new()
.push(ct1)
.push(ct2)
.push(ct3)
.push(ct4)
.build()
.unwrap();
let serialized = bincode::serialize(&compressed_list).unwrap();
println!("Serialized size: {} bytes", serialized.len());
let compressed_list: CompressedCiphertextList = bincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
let a: FheUint32 = compressed_list.get(0).unwrap().unwrap();
let b: FheInt64 = compressed_list.get(1).unwrap().unwrap();
let c: FheBool = compressed_list.get(2).unwrap().unwrap();
let d: FheUint2 = compressed_list.get(3).unwrap().unwrap();
let a: u32 = a.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(a, 17);
let b: i64 = b.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(b, -1);
let c = c.decrypt(&ck);
assert!(!c);
let d: u8 = d.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(d, 3);
// Out of bound index
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheBool>(4).unwrap().is_none());
// Incorrect type
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheInt64>(0).is_err());
// Correct type but wrong number of bits
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheUint16>(0).is_err());
}Compressing keysCompressing server keysThis example shows how to compress the server keys:use tfhe::{
set_server_key, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8,
};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let cks = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_sks = CompressedServerKey::new(&cks);
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed_sks).unwrap().len()
);
let sks = compressed_sks.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&sks).unwrap().len()
);
set_server_key(sks);
let clear_a = 12u8;
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(clear_a, &cks).unwrap();
let c = a + 234u8;
let decrypted: u8 = c.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a.wrapping_add(234));
}
Compressed public keysThis example shows how to compress the classical public keys:It is not currently recommended to use the CompressedPublicKey to encrypt ciphertexts without first decompressing them. If the resulting PublicKey is too large to fit in memory, it may result in significant slowdowns.This issue has been identified and will be addressed in future releases.use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, CompressedPublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let compressed_public_key = CompressedPublicKey::new(&client_key);
println!("compressed size : {}", bincode::serialize(&compressed_public_key).unwrap().len());
let public_key = compressed_public_key.decompress();
println!("decompressed size: {}", bincode::serialize(&public_key).unwrap().len());
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(213u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear, 213u8);
}Compressed compact public keyThis example shows how to use compressed compact public keys:use tfhe::{

Data versioning | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingData versioningData versioning and backward compatibilityThis document explains how to save and load versioned data using the data versioning feature.Starting from v0.6.4, TFHE-rs supports versioned data types. This allows you to store data and load it in the future without compatibility concerns. This feature is done by the tfhe-versionable crate.This versioning scheme is compatible with all the data formats supported by serde.Saving and loading versioned dataTo use the versioning feature, wrap your types in their versioned equivalents before serialization using the versionize method. You can load serialized data with the unversionize function, even in newer versions of TFHE-rs where the data types might evolve. The unversionize function manages any necessary data type upgrades, ensuring compatibility.

}VersionizeCalling .versionize() on a value will add versioning tags. This is done recursively so all the subtypes that compose it are versioned too. Under the hood, it converts the value into an enum where each version of a type is represented by a new variant. The returned object can be serialized using serde: bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &versioned_client_key).unwrap();UnversionizeThe Type::unversionize() function takes a versioned value, upgrades it to the latest version of its type and removes the version tags. To do that, it matches the version in the versioned enum and eventually apply a conversion function that upgrades it to the most recent version. The resulting value can then be used inside TFHE-rs let loaded_client_key =
ClientKey::unversionize(versioned_client_key).unwrap();Breaking changesWhen possible, data will be upgraded automatically without any kind of interaction. However, some changes might need information that are only known by the user of the library. These are called data breaking changes.

# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs

Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingSerialization/deserializationThis document explains the serialization and deserialization features that are useful to send data to a server to perform the computations.Safe serialization/deserializationWhen dealing with sensitive types, it's important to implement safe serialization and safe deserialization functions to prevent runtime errors and enhance security. TFHE-rs provide easy to use functions for this purpose, such as safe_serialize, safe_deserialize and safe_deserialize_conformant.Here is a basic example on how to use it:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, safe_serialize};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
// The last argument is the max allowed size for the serialized buffer
safe_serialize(&server_key, &mut buffer, 1 << 30).unwrap();
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}The safe deserialization must take the output of a safe-serialization as input. During the process, the following validation occurs:Type match: deserializing type A from a serialized type B raises an error indicating "On deserialization, expected type A, got type B".Version compatibility: data serialized in previous versions of TFHE-rs are automatically upgraded to the latest version using the data versioning feature.Parameter compatibility: deserializing an object of type A with one set of crypto parameters from an object of type A with another set of crypto parameters raises an error indicating "Deserialized object of type A not conformant with given parameter set"If both parameter sets have the same LWE dimension for ciphertexts, a ciphertext from param 1 may not fail this deserialization check with param 2.This check can't distinguish ciphertexts/server keys from independent client keys with the same parameters.This check is meant to prevent runtime errors in server homomorphic operations by checking that server keys and ciphertexts are compatible with the same parameter set.You can use the standalone is_conformant method to check parameter compatibility. Besides, the safe_deserialize_conformant function includes the parameter compatibility check, and the safe_deserialize function does not include the compatibility check.Size limit: both serialization and deserialization processes expect a size limit (measured in bytes) for the serialized data:On serialization, an error is raised if the serialized output exceeds the specific limit.On deserialization, an error is raised if the serialized input exceeds the specific limit.This feature aims to gracefully return an error in case of an attacker trying to cause an out-of-memory error on deserialization.Here is a more complete example:
use tfhe::conformance::ParameterSetConformant;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_serialize, safe_deserialize_conformant};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128};
use tfhe::conformance::ListSizeConstraint;
use tfhe::{
generate_keys, FheUint8, CompactCiphertextList, FheUint8ConformanceParams,
CompactPublicKey, ConfigBuilder, CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams
};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
let params_2 = PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
assert_ne!(params_1, params_2);
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let conformance_params_1 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_1);
let conformance_params_2 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_2);
let public_key = CompactPublicKey::new(&client_key);
let msg = 27u8;
let ct = FheUint8::try_encrypt(msg, &client_key).unwrap();
assert!(ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_1));
assert!(!ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_2));
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&ct, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
assert!(safe_deserialize_conformant::<FheUint8>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_2)
.is_err());
let ct2: FheUint8 = safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_1)
.unwrap();
let dec: u8 = ct2.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(msg, dec);
// Example with a compact list:
let msgs = [27, 188u8];
let mut builder = CompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key);
builder.extend(msgs.iter().copied());
let compact_list = builder.build();
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&compact_list, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
let conformance_params = CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams {
shortint_params: params_1.to_shortint_conformance_param(),
num_elements_constraint: ListSizeConstraint::exact_size(2),
};
safe_deserialize_conformant::<CompactCiphertextList>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params)
.unwrap();
}The safe serialization and deserialization use bincode internally.To selectively disable some of the features of the safe serialization, you can use SerializationConfig/DeserializationConfig builders. For example, it is possible to disable the data versioning:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, SerializationConfig};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
SerializationConfig::new(1 << 30).disable_versioning().serialize_into(&server_key, &mut buffer).unwrap();
// You will still be able to load this item with `safe_deserialize_conformant`, but only using the current version of TFHE-rs
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}Serialization/deserialization using serdeTFHE-rs uses the Serde framework and implements Serde's Serialize and Deserialize traits.This allows you to serialize into any data format supported by serde. However, this is a more bare bone approach as none of the checks described in the previous section will be performed for you.In the following example, we use bincode for its binary format:
[dependencies]
# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs
tfhe = { version = "~1.4.1", features = ["integer"] }
bincode = "1.3.3"
use std::io::Cursor;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, ServerKey, generate_keys, set_server_key, FheUint8};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>{
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
let value_1 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg1, &client_key);
let value_2 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg2, &client_key);
// Prepare to send data to the server
// The ClientKey is _not_ sent
let mut serialized_data = Vec::new();
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &server_key)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_1)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_2)?;
// Simulate sending serialized data to a server and getting
// back the serialized result
let serialized_result = server_function(&serialized_data)?;
let result: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize(&serialized_result)?;
let output: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(output, msg1 + msg2);
Ok(())
}
fn server_function(serialized_data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut serialized_data = Cursor::new(serialized_data);

# Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rs

Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresEncrypted pseudo random valuesThis document explains the mechanism and steps to generate an oblivious encrypted random value using only server keys.The goal is to give to the server the possibility to generate a random value, which will be obtained in an encrypted format and will remain unknown to the server. The implementation is based on this article.This is possible through two methods on FheUint and FheInt:generate_oblivious_pseudo_random which return an integer taken uniformly in the full integer range ([0; 2^N[ for a FheUintN and [-2^(N-1); 2^(N-1)[ for a FheIntN).generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded which return an integer taken uniformly in [0; 2^random_bits_count[. For a FheUintN, we must have random_bits_count <= N. For a FheIntN, we must have random_bits_count <= N - 1.Both methods functions take a seed Seed as input, which could be any u128 value. They both rely on the use of the usual server key. The output is reproducible, i.e., the function is deterministic from the inputs: assuming the same hardware, seed and server key, this function outputs the same random encrypted value.Here is an example of the usage: tfhe::prelude::FheDecrypt;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8, FheInt8, Seed};
pub fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let random_bits_count = 3;
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(dec_result < (1 << random_bits_count));
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(dec_result < (1 << random_bits_count));

# Noise squashing | TFHE-rs

Noise squashing | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresNoise squashingIn the context of confidential blockchain protocols, like the Zama protocol, for security reasons the threshold decryption requires to hide the intrinsic noise of FHE operations. This can be achieved by the MPC nodes by adding large amounts of random noise before they perform the actual decryption. In order to have enough room for that large noise that needs to be added before decryption, the noise squashing operation is performed.TFHE-rs' High Level API provides APIs to do just that, here is how one would use those primitives: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
NOISE_SQUASHING_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,

use tfhe::*;
// We use an identity function to verify FHE operations, it is fine in this context
#[allow(clippy::eq_op)]
pub fn main() {
// Configure computations enabling the noise squashing capability.
let config =
ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128)
.enable_noise_squashing(NOISE_SQUASHING_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128)
.build();
// Generate the keys
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Set the key once for our various examples
set_server_key(sks);
// FheUint32 case
let clear: u32 = 42;
// Encrypt
let enc = FheUint32::encrypt(clear, &cks);
// Simulate a bitand on the blockchain
let bitand = &enc & &enc;
// Perform the noise squashing
let squashed = bitand.squash_noise().unwrap();
// We don't perform the noise flooding, but here verify that the noise squashing preserves our
// data
let recovered: u32 = squashed.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(clear, recovered);
// FheInt16 case
let clear: i16 = -42;
let enc = FheInt10::encrypt(clear, &cks);
let bitand = &enc & &enc;
let squashed = bitand.squash_noise().unwrap();
let recovered: i16 = squashed.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(clear, recovered);

let bitand = &enc & &enc;
let squashed = bitand.squash_noise().unwrap();
let recovered: bool = squashed.decrypt(&cks);

}
CompressionLike regular ciphertexts, squashed noise ciphertexts can be stored into a list and compressed to reduce their size.To do that, use CompressedSquashedNoiseCiphertextList::builder:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{

set_server_key(sks);
// Encrypt some values

let clear_b: u32 = 1025;
let clear_c = false;
let a = FheInt32::encrypt(clear_a, &cks);

# Overflow detection | TFHE-rs

Overflow detection | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresOverflow detectionThis document explains how TFHE-rs implements specific operations to detect overflows in computations.The mechanism of detecting overflow consists in returning an encrypted flag with a specific ciphertext that reflects the state of the computation. When an overflow occurs, this flag is set to true. Since the server is not able to evaluate this encrypted value, the client has to check the flag value when decrypting to determine if an overflow has happened.These operations might be slower than their non-overflow-detecting equivalent, so they are not enabled by default. To use them, you must explicitly call specific operators. At the moment, only additions, subtractions, and multiplications are supported. We plan to add more operations in future releases.Here's the list of operations supported along with their symbol:Addoverflow_addBinarySuboverflow_subBinaryMuloverflow_mulBinaryThe usage of these operations is similar to the standard ones. The key difference is in the decryption process, as shown in following example:
//
// * The operation is modular, i.e on overflow the result wraps around.
// * On overflow the [FheBool] is true, otherwise false

# Public key encryption | TFHE-rs

Public key encryption | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresPublic key encryptionThis document explains public key encryption and provides instructions for 2 methods.Public key encryption refers to the cryptographic paradigm where the encryption key can be publicly distributed, whereas the decryption key remains secret to the owner. This differs from the usual case where the same secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. In TFHE-rs, there are two methods for public key encryptions:Classical public key: the first method involves the public key containing many encryptions of zero, as detailed in Guide to Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the [Discretized] Torus, Appendix A.Compact public key: the second method is based on the paper TFHE Public-Key Encryption Revisited, allowing for significantly smaller key sizes compared to the first method.Public keys can also be compressed to reduce size.Classical public keyThis example shows how to use classical public keys. tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, PublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(255u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear, 255u8);
}Compact public keyThis example shows how to use compact public keys. The main difference is in the ConfigBuilder where the parameter set has been changed.For more information on using compact public keys to encrypt data and generate a zero-knowledge proof of correct encryption at the same time, see the guide on ZK proofs.use tfhe::{

# Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rs

Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresMulti-threading with Rayon crateThis document describes how to use Rayon for parallel processing in TFHE-rs, detailing configurations for single and multi-client applications with code examples.Rayon is a popular Rust crate that simplifies writing multi-threaded code. You can use Rayon to write multi-threaded TFHE-rs code. However, due to the specifications of Rayon and TFHE-rs, certain setups are necessary.Single-client applicationThe problemThe high-level API requires to call set_server_key on each thread where computations need to be done. So a first attempt to use Rayon with TFHE-rs might look like this: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
// set_server_key in each closure as they might be
// running in different threads
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
}However, due to Rayon's work-stealing mechanism and TFHE-rs' internals, this may create BorrowMutError.Working exampleThe correct way is to call rayon::broadcast as follows:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
// set the server key in all of the rayon's threads so that
// we won't need to do it later
rayon::broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks.clone()));
// Set the server key in the main thread
set_server_key(sks);
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
let a: u8 = a.decrypt(&cks);
let b: u8 = b.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(a, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b, 6u8);
}Multi-client applicationsFor applications that need to operate concurrently on data from different clients and require each client to use multiple threads, you need to create separate Rayon thread pools:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks1, sks1) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks1),
];
let ys1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks1),
];
let (cks2, sks2) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(100u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(200u8, &cks2),
];
let ys2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(103u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(204u8, &cks2),
];
let client_1_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
let client_2_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(2).build().unwrap();
client_1_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));
client_2_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks2.clone()));
let ((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) = rayon::join(|| {
client_1_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs1[0] + &ys1[0]
},
|| {
&xs1[1] + &ys1[1]
}
)
})
}, || {
client_2_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs2[0] + &ys2[0]
},
|| {
&xs2[1] + &ys2[1]
}
)
})
});
let a1: u8 = a1.decrypt(&cks1);
let b1: u8 = b1.decrypt(&cks1);
assert_eq!(a1, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b1, 6u8);
let a2: u8 = a2.decrypt(&cks2);
let b2: u8 = b2.decrypt(&cks2);
assert_eq!(a2, 203u8);
assert_eq!(b2, 148u8);
}This can be useful if you have some rust #[test], see the example below:#[test]
fn test_1() {
let pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));

})
}

In this context, F should be understood as any FHE computation that must remain secure under the sIND-CPA^D model. All encrypted inputs to F must be re-randomized prior to execution.Example: Re-randomization of two FheUint64 values before addition tfhe::prelude::*;

For example, when computing the sum of a list of ciphertexts, you typically initialize the sum variable to 0.Instead of asking the client to send an actual encrypted zero, the server can use a trivial encryption. A trivial encryption creates a ciphertext that contains the desired value but isn't securely encrypted - essentially anyone, any key can decrypt it. tfhe::prelude::*;

Key upgrade | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresKey upgradeThis document describes how one can use the UpgradeKeyChain to be able to easily upgrade a ciphertext that is under older parameters to newer parameters.It is different and complementary to the data versioning feature, as the data versioning feature allows loading ciphertexts generated with a previous TFHE-rs version if the ciphertext structurally changed.The UpgradeKeyChain first needs to know about possible parameters, for that, add_key_set should be called with all the different server keys. Note that the Tag of the keys is used to differentiate them.Then, the UpgradeKeyChain requires upgrade keys to be able to upgrade ciphertexts, there are two types of these keys:KeySwitchingKey to upgrade a FheUint/FheInt/FheBool to another FheUint/FheInt/FheBool with different parametersDecompressionUpgradeKey to upgrade ciphertexts from a CompressedCiphertextList to FheUint/FheInt/FheBool with different parameters tfhe::shortint::parameters::{

# Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rs

Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresZero-knowledge proofsThis document explains how to implement the zero-knowledge proofs function for compact public key encryption to verify the encryption process without revealing the encrypted information.TFHE-rs can generate zero-knowledge proofs to verify that the compact public key encryption process is correct. In other words, TFHE-rs generates the proof without revealing any information other than the already known range of the encrypted message. This technique is derived from Libert’s work.You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=zk-pok when building TFHE-rs.To use this feature, you must first generate a CRS (Common Reference String). The CRS is a piece of cryptographic data that is necessary to ensure the security of zero-knowledge proofs. The CRS should be generated in advance and shared between all the clients and the server. A CRS can be reused for multiple encryptions with the same parameters.Once the CRS is generated, using zero-knowledge proofs is straightforward: during encryption, the client generates the proof, and the server validates it before performing any homomorphic computations.Note that you need to use dedicated parameters for the compact public key encryption. This helps to reduce the size of encrypted data and speed up the zero-knowledge proof computation.The following example shows how a client can encrypt and prove a ciphertext, and how a server can verify and compute the ciphertext: rand::prelude::*;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};
pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Indicate which parameters to use for the Compact Public Key encryption
let cpk_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_PKE_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// And parameters allowing to keyswitch/cast to the computation parameters.
let casting_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_KEYSWITCH_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Enable the dedicated parameters on the config
let config = tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params)
.use_dedicated_compact_public_key_parameters((cpk_params, casting_params)).build();
// The CRS should be generated in an offline phase then shared to all clients and the server
let crs = CompactPkeCrs::from_config(config, 64).unwrap();
// Then use TFHE-rs as usual
let client_key = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let server_key = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&client_key);
let public_key = tfhe::CompactPublicKey::try_new(&client_key).unwrap();
// This can be left empty, but if provided allows to tie the proof to arbitrary data
let metadata = [b'T', b'F', b'H', b'E', b'-', b'r', b's'];
let clear_a = rng.gen::<u64>();
let clear_b = rng.gen::<u64>();
let proven_compact_list = tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(clear_a)
.push(clear_b)
.build_with_proof_packed(&crs, &metadata, ZkComputeLoad::Verify)?;
// Server side
let result = {
set_server_key(server_key);
// Verify the ciphertexts
let expander =
proven_compact_list.verify_and_expand(&crs, &public_key, &metadata)?;
let a: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(0)?.unwrap();
let b: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(1)?.unwrap();
a + b
};
// Back on the client side
let a_plus_b: u64 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(a_plus_b, clear_a.wrapping_add(clear_b));
Ok(())
}You can choose a more costly proof with ZkComputeLoad::Proof, which has a faster verification time. Alternatively, you can select ZkComputeLoad::Verify for a faster proof and slower verification.Scheme versionThe ZK scheme used to generate and verify proofs is available in two versions:ZKV1: This version is close to the original paper from Libert.ZKV2: Differing from the paper, this version provides better performance for provers and verifiers.TFHE-rs selects automatically the scheme to use based on the encryption parameters during the CRS generation. With default parameters, ZKV2 is selected.The following example shows how to generate a CRS and proofs for ZKV1. Compared to the previous example, only the parameters are changed:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};
pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced Rust setupThis document provides basic instructions to configure the Rust toolchain and features for TFHE-rs.TFHE-rs requires a nightly Rust toolchain to build the C API and utilize advanced SIMD instructions. However, for other uses, a stable toolchain (version 1.81 or later) is sufficient.Follow the following instructions to install the necessary Rust toolchain:
rustup toolchain install stable
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup toolchain install nightlySetting the toolchainYou can set the toolchain using either of the following methods.Manually specify the toolchain for each cargo command:
cargo +stable build --release
cargo +stable test --release
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo +nightly build --release
cargo +nightly test --releaseOverride the toolchain for the current project:
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup override set stable
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo build --release
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup override set nightly
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
cargo build --releaseTo verify the default toolchain used by Cargo, execute:Choosing your featuresTFHE-rs provides various cargo features to customize the types and features used.Homomorphic typesThis crate provides 4 kinds of data types. Each kind is enabled by activating the corresponding feature in the TOML line and has multiple types:BooleansbooleanBooleansShortIntsshortintShort integersIntegersintegerArbitrary-sized integersIntegers+extended-typesNon-standard sized integersStringsstringsASCII stringsThe Integers+ kind refers to types which have non-standard bit-width like FheUint24 for example. Having more granular types can allow to improve performance. The feature is not enabled by default to avoid very long compile times if users don't need the extended-types.AVX-512While the library generally selects automatically the best instruction sets available by the host, in the case of 'AVX-512', you have to choose it explicitly.

Contributing | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingThis document provides guidance on how to contribute to TFHE-rs.There are two ways to contribute:Report issues: Open issues on GitHub to report bugs, suggest improvements, or note typos.Submit codes: To become an official contributor, you must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Our CLA-bot will guide you through this process when you open your first pull request.1. Setting up the projectStart by forking the TFHE-rs repository.Rust version: Ensure that you use a Rust version >= 1.81 to compile TFHE-rs.Incompatibility: AArch64-based machines are not yet supported for Windows as it's currently missing an entropy source to be able to seed the CSPRNGs used in TFHE-rs.Performance: For optimal performance, it is highly recommended to run TFHE-rs code in release mode with cargo's --release flag.To get more details about the library, please refer to the documentation.2. Creating a new branchWhen creating your branch, make sure to use the following format :For example:3. Before committing3.1 LintingEach commit to TFHE-rs should conform to the standards of the project. In particular, every source code, docker or workflows files should be linted to prevent programmatic and stylistic errors.Rust source code linters: clippyTypescript/Javascript source code linters: eslint, prettierTo apply automatic code formatting, run:You can perform linting of all Cargo targets with:3.2 TestingYour contributions must include comprehensive documentation and tests without breaking existing tests. To run pre-commit checks, execute:This command ensure that all the targets in the library are building correctly. For a faster check, use:If you're contributing to GPU code, run also:Unit testing suites are heavy and can require a lot of computing power and RAM availability. Whilst tests are run automatically in continuous integration pipeline, you can run tests locally.All unit tests have a command formatted as:Run make help to display a list of all the commands available.To quickly test your changes locally, follow these steps:Locate where the code has changed.Add (or modify) a Cargo test filter to the corresponding make target in Makefile.Run the target.make test_<something> will print the underlying cargo command in STDOUT. You can quickly test your changes by copy/pasting the command and then modify it to suit your needs.For example, if you made changes in tfhe/src/integer/*, you can test them with the following steps:In test_integer target, replace the filter -- integer:: by -- my_new_test.Run make test_integer.4. CommittingTFHE-rs follows the conventional commit specification to maintain a consistent commit history, essential for Semantic Versioning (semver.org). Commit messages are automatically checked in CI and will be rejected if they do not comply, so make sure that you follow the commit conventions detailed on this page.5. RebasingBefore creating a pull request, rebase your branch on the repository's main branch. Merge commits are not permitted, thus rebasing ensures fewer conflicts and a smoother PR review process.6. Opening a Pull RequestOnce your changes are ready, open a pull request.For instructions on creating a PR from a fork, refer to GitHub's official documentation.7. Continuous integrationBefore a pull request can be merged, several test suites run automatically. Below is an overview of the CI process:title: Continuous Integration Process

Data versioningData serialized with TFHE-rs must remain backward compatible. This is done using the tfhe-versionable crate.If you modify a type that derives Versionize in a backward-incompatible way, an upgrade implementation must be provided.For example, these changes are data breaking:Adding a field to a struct.Changing the order of the fields within a struct or the variants within an enum.Renaming a field of a struct or a variant of an enum.Changing the type of field in a struct or a variant in an enum.On the contrary, these changes are not data breaking:Renaming a type (unless it implements the Named trait).Adding a variant to the end of an enum.Historical data from previous TFHE-rs versions are stored inside utils/tfhe-backward-compat-data. They are used to check on every PR that backward compatibility has been preserved.Example: adding a fieldSuppose you want to add an i32 field to a type named MyType. The original type is defined as:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
}And you want to change it to:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
other_val: i32
}Follow these steps:Navigate to the definition of the dispatch enum of this type. This is the type inside the #[versionize(MyTypeVersions)] macro attribute. In general, this type has the same name as the base type with a Versions suffix. You should find something likeenum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyType)
}Add a new variant to the enum to preserve the previous version of the type. You can simply copy and paste the previous definition of the type and add a version suffix:struct MyTypeV1 {
val: u64,
}
#[derive(VersionsDispatch)]
enum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyTypeV1),
V2(MyType) // Here this points to your modified type
}Implement the Upgrade trait to define how we should go from the previous version to the current version: type Error = Infallible;
fn upgrade(self) -> Result<MyType, Self::Error> {
Ok(MyType {
val: self.val,
other_val: 0
})
}
}Fix the upgrade target of the previous version. In this example, impl Upgrade<MyType> for MyTypeV0 { should simply be changed to impl Upgrade<MyTypeV1> for MyTypeV0 {PreviousTFHE deep diveLast updated 25 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

What is TFHE-rs? | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageWhat is TFHE-rs?TFHE-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) to perform Boolean and integer arithmetic on encrypted data.TFHE-rs implements advanced TFHE features, empowering developers and researchers with fine-grained control over TFHE so that they can focus on high-level functionality without delving into low-level implementation.TFHE-rs includes:Rust API: the primary API for working with TFHE-rs in Rust projects.C API: for developers who prefer to use C.Client-side WASM API: to integrate TFHE-rs functionalities into WebAssembly applications.Key cryptographic conceptsTFHE is a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme based on Learning With Errors (LWE), which is a secure cryptographic primitive against even quantum computers. The TFHE-rs library implements Zama’s variant of TFHE.Homomorphic Encryption BasicsThe basic elements of cryptography:Message (or Cleartext): raw values before encryption.Plaintext: encoded messages.Ciphertext: encrypted messages.FHE allows to compute on ciphertexts without revealing the content of the messages. A scheme is fully homomorphic if it supports at least two of the following operations when evaluating any programs. (xxx is a plaintext and E[x]E[x]E[x] is the corresponding ciphertext):Homomorphic univariate function evaluation: f(E[x])=E[f(x)]f(E[x]) = E[f(x)]f(E[x])=E[f(x)]Homomorphic addition: E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]E[x] + E[y] = E[x + y]E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]Homomorphic multiplication: E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]E[x] * E[y] = E[x * y]E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]Zama's variant of TFHEZama's variant of TFHE is a fully homomorphic scheme that takes fixed-precision numbers as messages. It implements all homomorphic operations needed, such as addition and function evaluation via Programmable Bootstrapping.Refer to the preliminary whitepaper for more details.Using TFHE-rs in Rust includes the following steps:Key generation: generate a pair of keys using secure parameters.Client key: used for encryption and decryption of data. This key must be kept secret.Server key (or Evaluation key): used for performing operations on encrypted data. This key could be public.Encryption: encrypt plaintexts using the client key to produce ciphertexts.Homomorphic operation: perform operations on ciphertexts using the server key.Decryption: decrypt the resulting ciphertexts back to plaintexts using the client key.To understand more about FHE applications, see the 6-minute introduction to homomorphic encryption.PreviousWelcome to TFHE-rsNextInstallationLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# GPU acceleration | TFHE-rs

GPU acceleration | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationTFHE-rs has a CUDA GPU backend that enables faster integer arithmetic operations on encrypted data, when compared to the default CPU backend. This guide explains how to update your existing program to leverage GPU acceleration, or to start a new program using GPU.To explore a simple code example, go to:A simple exampleFHE performance on GPUThe GPU backend is up to 4.2x faster than the CPU one. For a comparison between CPU and GPU latencies, see the following page.BenchmarksDifferent integer operations obtain different speedups. Please refer to the detailed GPU benchmarks of FHE operations for detailed figures.To reproduce TFHE-rs GPU benchmarks, see this dedicated page. To obtain the best performance when running benchmarks, set the environment variable CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER to avoid CUDA API overheads during the first kernel execution. Bear in mind that GPU warmup is necessary before doing performance measurements.GPU TFHE-rs featuresBy default, the GPU backend uses specific cryptographic parameters. When calling the tfhe::ConfigBuilder::default() function, the cryptographic for PBS will be:PBS parameters: PARAM_GPU_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_4_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBSThese PBS parameters are accompanied by the following compression parameters:Compression parameters: COMP_PARAM_GPU_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_4_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBSTFHE-rs uses dedicated parameters for the GPU in order to achieve optimal performance, and the CPU and GPU parameters cannot be mixed to perform computation and compression for security reasons.The GPU backend is designed to speed up server-side FHE operations and supports the following TFHE-rs features:FHE ciphertext operationsCiphertext compressionCiphertext arraysZK-POK proof expansionNoise SquashingMulti-GPU for throughput optimizationThe following features are not supported:Key generationEncryption/decryptionZK-POK proof generation and verificationEncrypted strings and operations on encrypted stringsGPU programming modelThe GPU TFHE-rs integer API is mostly identical to the CPU API: both integer datatypes and operations syntax are the same. All the while, some GPU program design principles must be considered:Key generation, encryption, and decryption are performed on the CPU. When used in operations, ciphertexts are automatically copied to or from the first GPU that the user configures for TFHE-rs.GPU syntax for integer FHE operations, key generation, and serialization is identical with equivalent CPU code.When configured to compile for the GPU, TFHE-rs uses GPU specific cryptographic parameters that give high performance on the GPU. Ciphertexts and server-keys that are generated with CPU parameters can be processed with GPU-enabled TFHE-rs but performance is considerably degraded.Each server key instance is assigned to a set of GPUs, which are automatically used in parallel. To set the active GPUs for a CPU thread, activate the server key assigned to the GPUs you want to use.GPU integer operations are synchronous to the calling thread. To execute in parallel on several GPUs, use Rust parallel constructs such as par_iter.The key differences between the CPU API and the GPU API are:The GPU backend only supports compressed server keys that must be decompressed on a GPU selected by the user.For ciphertext compression the cryptographic parameters must be chosen by the user from the GPU parameter set.For ciphertext arrays, GPU-specific ciphertext array types must be used instead of CPU ones.Project configuration1.

WebWhen using the Web WASM target, you should call an additional init function. With parallelism enabled, you need to call another additional initThreadPool function.Example: initThreadPool, // only available with parallelism
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfhePublicKey,
} from "./pkg/tfhe.js";
async function example() {

}Compiling the WASM APIUse the provided Makefile in the TFHE-rs repository to compile for the desired target:make build_node_js_api for the Node.js APImake build_web_js_api for the browser APImake build_web_js_api_parallel for the browser API with parallelismThe compiled WASM packages are located in tfhe/pkg.The browser API and the Node.js API are available as npm packages. Using npm i tfhe for the browser API and npm i node-tfhe for the Node.js API.Extra steps for web bundlersWhen using the browser API with parallelism, some extra step might be needed depending on the bundler used:Usage with WebpackIf you're using Webpack v5 (version >= 5.25.1), you don't need to do anything special, as it already supports bundling Workers out of the box.Usage with ParcelParcel v2 also recognises the used syntax and works out of the box.Usage with RollupFor Rollup, you'll need @surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread plugin (version >= 2.1.0) which brings the same functionality and was tested with this crate.Alternatively, you can use Vite which has necessary plugins built-in.(Taken from RReverser/wasm-bindgen-rayon)Using the JS on WASM APITFHE-rs uses WASM to provide a JavaScript (JS) binding to the client-side primitives, like key generation and encryption within the Boolean and shortint modules.Currently, there are several limitations. Due to a lack of threading support in WASM, key generation can be too slow to be practical for bigger parameter sets.Some parameter sets lead to the FHE keys exceeding the 2GB memory limit of WASM, making these parameter sets virtually unusable.First steps using TFHE-rs JS on WASM APISetting up TFHE-rs JS on WASM API for Node.js programs.To build the JS on WASM bindings for TFHE-rs, install wasm-pack and the necessary rust toolchain. Cone the TFHE-rs repository and build using the following commands (this will build using the default branch, you can check out a specific tag depending on your requirements):Cloning into 'tfhe-rs'...

# Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic parity bitThis tutorial shows how to build a small function that homomorphically computes a parity bit in 2 steps:Write a non-generic functionUse generics to handle the case where the function inputs are both FheBools and clear bools.The parity bit function processes two parameters:A slice of BooleanA mode (Odd or Even)This function returns a Boolean (true or false) so that the total count of true values across the input and the result matches with the specified parity mode (Odd or Even).Non-generic version
tfhe = { version = "~1.3.3", features = ["integer"] }First, define the verification function.The function initializes the parity bit to false, then applies the XOR operation across all bits, adding negation based on the requested mode.The validation function also adds the number of the bits set in the input to the computed parity bit and checks whether the sum is even or odd, depending on the mode.

}Generic versionTo enable the compute_parity_bit function to operate with both encrypted FheBool and plain bool, we introduce generics. This approach allows for validation using clear data and facilitates debugging.Writing generic functions that incorporate operator overloading for our Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) types is more complex than usual because FHE types do not implement the Copy trait. Consequently, it is necessary to use references (&) with these types, unlike native types, which typically implement Copy.This complicates generic bounds at first.Writing the correct trait boundsThe function has the following signature: fhe_bits: &[FheBool],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> boolTo make it generic, the first steps is: fhe_bits: &[BoolType],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> BoolTypeNext, define the generic bounds with the where clause.In the function, you can use the following operators:! (trait: Not)^ (trait: BitXor)Adding them to where, it gives: BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, the compiler will return an error:error[E0369]: no implementation for `&BoolType ^ BoolType`

error: aborting due to previous errorfhe_bit is a reference to a BoolType (&BoolType), because BoolType is borrowed from the fhe_bits slice during iteration. To fix the error, the first approach could be changing the BitXor bounds to what the Compiler suggests, by requiring &BoolType to implement BitXor rather than BoolType. BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
&BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, this approach still leads to an error:error[E0637]: `&` without an explicit lifetime name cannot be used here

# Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rs

Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageParallelized PBSThis document describes the implementation and benefits of parallelized Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) in TFHE-rs, including code examples for using multi-bit PBS parameters and ensuring deterministic execution.Parallelized Programmable BootstrappingProgrammable Bootstrapping is inherently a sequential operation. However, some recent results showed that introducing parallelism is feasible at the expense of larger keys, thereby enhancing the performance of PBS. This new PBS is called a multi-bit PBS.TFHE-rs can already perform parallel execution of integer homomorphic operations. Activating this feature can lead to performance improvements, particularly in the case of high core-count CPUs when enough cores are available, or when dealing with operations that require small input message precision.The following example shows how to use parallelized bootstrapping by choosing multi-bit PBS parameters: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::current_params::V1_3_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(V1_3_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())
}Deterministic parallelized Programmable BootstrappingBy nature, the parallelized PBS might not be deterministic: while the resulting ciphertext will always decrypt to the correct plaintext, the order of the operations could vary, resulting in different output ciphertext. To ensure a consistent ciphertext output regardless of execution order, add the with_deterministic_execution() suffix to the parameters.Here's an example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::current_params::V1_3_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(
V1_3_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64.with_deterministic_execution(),
)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore crypto APIQuick startThe core_crypto module from TFHE-rs is dedicated to the implementation of the cryptographic tools related to TFHE. To construct an FHE application, the shortint and/or Boolean modules (based on core_crypto) are recommended.The core_crypto module offers an API to low-level cryptographic primitives and objects, like lwe_encryption or rlwe_ciphertext. The goal is to propose an easy-to-use API for cryptographers.The overall code architecture is split in two parts: one for entity definitions and another focused on algorithms. The entities contain the definition of useful types, like LWE ciphertext or bootstrapping keys. The algorithms are then naturally defined to work using these entities.The API is convenient to add or modify existing algorithms, or to have direct access to the raw data. Even if the LWE ciphertext object is defined, along with functions giving access to the body, it is also possible to bypass these to get directly the ithi^{th}ith element of LWE mask.For instance, the code to encrypt and then decrypt a message looks like: tfhe::core_crypto::prelude::*;
// DISCLAIMER: these toy example parameters are not guaranteed to be secure or yield correct
// computations
// Define parameters for LweCiphertext creation
let lwe_dimension = LweDimension(742);
let lwe_noise_distribution =
Gaussian::from_dispersion_parameter(StandardDev(0.000007069849454709433), 0.0);
let ciphertext_modulus = CiphertextModulus::new_native();
// Create the PRNG

let seeder = seeder.as_mut();

let lwe_secret_key =
allocate_and_generate_new_binary_lwe_secret_key(lwe_dimension, &mut secret_generator);
// Create the plaintext
let msg = 3u64;
let plaintext = Plaintext(msg << 60);
// Create a new LweCiphertext
let mut lwe = LweCiphertext::new(0u64, lwe_dimension.to_lwe_size(), ciphertext_modulus);
encrypt_lwe_ciphertext(
&lwe_secret_key,
&mut lwe,
plaintext,
lwe_noise_distribution,
&mut encryption_generator,
);
let decrypted_plaintext = decrypt_lwe_ciphertext(&lwe_secret_key, &lwe);
// Round and remove encoding
// First create a decomposer working on the high 4 bits corresponding to our encoding.
let decomposer = SignedDecomposer::new(DecompositionBaseLog(4), DecompositionLevelCount(1));
let rounded = decomposer.closest_representable(decrypted_plaintext.0);
// Remove the encoding
let cleartext = rounded >> 60;

# Boolean | TFHE-rs

Boolean | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanIn tfhe::boolean, the available operations are mainly related to their equivalent Boolean gates (i.e., AND, OR... etc). What follows are examples of a unary gate (NOT) and a binary gate (XOR). The last one is about the ternary MUX gate, which allows homomorphic computation of conditional statements of the form If..Then..Else.This library is meant to be used both on the server side and the client side. The typical use case should follow the subsequent steps:On the client side, generate the client and server keys.Send the server key to the server.Then any number of times:On the client side, encrypt the input data with the client key.Transmit the encrypted input to the server.On the server side, perform homomorphic computation with the server key.Transmit the encrypted output to the client.On the client side, decrypt the output data with the client key.SetupIn the first step, the client creates two keys, the client key and the server key, with the tfhe::boolean::gen_keys function: tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate the client key and the server key,
// using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key): (ClientKey, ServerKey) = gen_keys();
}The client_key is of type ClientKey. It is secret and must never be transmitted. This key will only be used to encrypt and decrypt data.The server_key is of type ServerKey. It is a public key and can be shared with any party. This key has to be sent to the server because it is required for homomorphic computation.Note that both the client_key and server_key implement the Serialize and Deserialize traits. This way you can use any compatible serializer to store/send the data. To store the server_key in a binary file, you can use the bincode library:use std::io::{Write, Read};
use tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE ----------------------------
// We generate a client key and a server key, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
// We serialize the server key to bytes, and store them in a file:
let encoded: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&server_key).unwrap();
// Create a tmp dir with the current user name to avoid cluttering the /tmp dir
let user = std::env::var("USER").unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_user".to_string());
let tmp_dir_for_user = &format!("/tmp/{user}");
create_dir_all(tmp_dir_for_user).unwrap();
let server_key_file = &format!("{tmp_dir_for_user}/tutorial_server_key.bin");
// We write the server key to a file:
let mut file = File::create(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to create server key file");
file.write_all(encoded.as_slice()).expect("failed to write key to file");
// ...
// We send the key to server side
// ...
//---------------------------- SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We read the file:
let mut file = File::open(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to open server key file");
let mut encoded: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
file.read_to_end(&mut encoded).expect("failed to read key");
// We deserialize the server key:
let key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize(&encoded[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
}Encrypting inputsOnce the server key is available on the server side, it is possible to perform some homomorphic computations. The client needs to encrypt some data and send it to the server. Again, the Ciphertext type implements the Serialize and the Deserialize traits, so that any serializer and communication tool suiting your use case can be employed:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE
// We use the client key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts:
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server somehow
// ...
}Encrypting inputs using a public keyAnyone (the server or a third party) with the public key can also encrypt some (or all) of the inputs. The public key can only be used to encrypt, not to decrypt.
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//---------------------------- SERVER or THIRD_PARTY SIDE
// We use the public key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts (if not on the server already):
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server to be deserialized (if not on the server already)
// ...
}Executing a Boolean circuitOnce the encrypted inputs are on the server side, the server_key can be used to homomorphically execute the desired Boolean circuit:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We deserialize the ciphertexts:
let ct_1: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_1[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
let ct_2: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_2[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// We use the server key to execute the boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);
// Then we serialize the output of the circuit:
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6)
.expect("failed to serialize output");
// ...
// And we send the output to the client
// ...
}Decrypting the outputOnce the encrypted output is on the client side, the client_key can be used to decrypt it:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_6 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON CLIENT SIDE
// We deserialize the output ciphertext:
let output: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_output[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// Finally, we decrypt the output:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&output);
// And check that the result is the expected one:
assert!(output);

# Integer | TFHE-rs

Integer | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegertfhe::integer is dedicated to integers smaller than 256 bits. The steps to homomorphically evaluate an integer circuit are described here.Key Typesinteger provides 3 basic key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages, thus this key is meant to be kept private and should never be shared. This key is created from parameter values that will dictate both the security and efficiency of computations. The parameters also set the maximum number of bits of message encrypted in a ciphertext.The ServerKey is the key that is used to actually do the FHE computations. It contains a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key. This key is created from a ClientKey that needs to be shared to the server, so it is not meant to be kept private. A user with a ServerKey can compute on the encrypted data sent by the owner of the associated ClientKey.To reflect this, computation/operation methods are tied to the ServerKey type.The PublicKey is a key used to encrypt messages. It can be publicly shared to allow users to encrypt data such that only the ClientKey holder will be able to decrypt. Encrypting with the PublicKey does not alter the homomorphic capabilities associated to the ServerKey.1. Key GenerationTo generate the keys, a user needs two parameters:A set of shortint cryptographic parameters.The number of ciphertexts used to encrypt an integer (we call them "shortint blocks").We are now going to build a pair of keys that can encrypt 8-bit integers (signed or unsigned) by using 4 shortint blocks that store 2 bits of message each.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}2. Encrypting valuesOnce we have our keys, we can encrypt values:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}3. Encrypting values with the public keyOnce the client key is generated, the public key can be derived and used to encrypt data.use tfhe::integer::PublicKey;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
//We generate the public key from the secret client key:
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//encryption
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the public key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg1, num_block);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg2, num_block);
}4. Computing and decryptingWith our server_key, and encrypted values, we can now do an addition and then decrypt the result.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128;
let msg2 = 13;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.add_parallelized(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsQuick startThis library makes it possible to execute homomorphic operations over encrypted data, where the data are either Booleans, short integers (named shortint in the rest of this documentation), or integers up to 256 bits. It allows you to execute a circuit on an untrusted server because both circuit inputs and outputs are kept private. Data are indeed encrypted on the client side, before being sent to the server. On the server side, every computation is performed on ciphertexts.The server, however, has to know the circuit to be evaluated. At the end of the computation, the server returns the encryption of the result to the user. Then the user can decrypt it with the secret key.General method to write an homomorphic circuit programThe overall process to write an homomorphic program is the same for all types. The basic steps for using the TFHE-rs library are the following:Choose a data type (Boolean, shortint, integer)Import the libraryCreate client and server keysEncrypt data with the client keyCompute over encrypted data using the server keyDecrypt data with the client keyAPI levels.This library has different modules, with different levels of abstraction.There is the core_crypto module, which is the lowest level API with the primitive functions and types of the TFHE scheme.Above the core_crypto module, there are the Boolean, shortint, and integer modules, which contain easy to use APIs enabling evaluation of Boolean, short integer, and integer circuits.Finally, there is the high-level module built on top of the Boolean, shortint, integer modules. This module is meant to abstract cryptographic complexities: no cryptographical knowledge is required to start developing an FHE application. Another benefit of the high-level module is the drastically simplified development process compared to lower level modules.high-level APITFHE-rs exposes a high-level API by default that includes datatypes that try to match Rust's native types by having overloaded operators (+, -, ...).Here is an example of how the high-level API is used:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
let result = a + b;
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintOperationsThe structure and operations related to short integers are described in this section.How a shortint is representedIn shortint, the encrypted data is stored in an LWE ciphertext.Conceptually, the message stored in an LWE ciphertext is divided into a carry buffer and a message buffer.The message buffer is the space where the actual message is stored. This represents the modulus of the input messages (denoted by MessageModulus in the code). When doing computations on a ciphertext, the encrypted message can overflow the message modulus. The part of the message which exceeds the message modulus is stored in the carry buffer. The size of the carry buffer is defined by another modulus, called CarryModulus.Together, the message modulus and the carry modulus form the plaintext space that is available in a ciphertext. This space cannot be overflowed, otherwise the computation may result in an incorrect output.In order to ensure the correctness of the computation, we track the maximum value encrypted in a ciphertext via an associated attribute called the degree. When the degree reaches a defined threshold, the carry buffer may be emptied to safely resume the computations. In shortint the carry modulus is considered useful as a means to do more computations.Types of operationsThe operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted valuesscalar operations that take at least one non-encrypted value as inputFor example, the addition has two variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (a so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space. Using this operation might have an impact on the correctness of the following operations;checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely;smart: always does the operation. If the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will clear the carry to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is to allow the modification of the carry, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value;default: always does the operation and always clears the carry. Could be slower than smart, but it ensures that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use operation typesLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of operations that we have already introduced. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavour may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise,checked and smart are the best options.Let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and a multiplication.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);

// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
println!("expected {}, found {}", ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus, output);
}During this computation, the carry buffer has been overflowed and, as all the operations were unchecked, the output may be incorrect.If we redo this same circuit with the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use std::error::Error;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ops = || -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {

},
}
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be cleaned during the computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);

server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings as long as this is the only kind of operation which is used.Using default could slow-down computations.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 3;
let scalar = 4;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.mul_lsb_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar as u64 - msg2) * msg2) % modulus);
}#List of available operationsCertain operations can only be used if the parameter set chosen is compatible with the bivariate programmable bootstrapping, meaning the carry buffer is larger than or equal to the message buffer. These operations are marked with a star (*).The list of implemented operations for shortint is:addition between two ciphertextsaddition between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalarcomparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between a ciphertext and an unencrypted scalardivision of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarLSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the result truncated to fit in the message buffermultiplication of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarbitwise shift <<, >>subtraction of a ciphertext by another ciphertextsubtraction of a ciphertext by an unencrypted scalarnegation of a ciphertextbitwise and, or and xor (*)comparisons <, <=, >, >=, ==, != between two ciphertexts (*)division between two ciphertexts (*)MSB multiplication between two ciphertexts returning the part overflowing the message buffer (*)Public key encryption.TFHE-rs supports both private and public key encryption methods. The only difference between both lies in the encryption step: in this case, the encryption method is called using public_key instead of client_key.Here is a small example on how to use public encryption:
fn main() {
// Generate the client key and the server key:
let (cks, _) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let pks = PublicKey::new(&cks);
let msg = 2;
// Encryption of one message:
let ct = pks.encrypt(msg);
// Decryption:
let dec = cks.decrypt(&ct);
assert_eq!(dec, msg);
}Arithmetic operations.Classical arithmetic operations are supported by shortint:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_add(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 + msg2) % modulus);
}bitwise operationsShort homomorphic integer types support some bitwise operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to homomorphically compute a bitwise AND:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_bitand(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 & msg2) % modulus);
}comparisonsShort homomorphic integer types support comparison operations.A simple example on how to use these operations:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 2;
let msg2 = 1;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.unchecked_greater_or_equal(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 >= msg2) as u64 % modulus);
}univariate function evaluationsA simple example on how to use this operation to homomorphically compute the hamming weight (i.e., the number of bits equal to one) of an encrypted number.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
// We use the private client key to encrypt a message:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
// Compute the lookup table for the univariate function:
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table(|n| n.count_ones().into());
// Apply the table lookup on the input message:
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table(&ct_1, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, msg1.count_ones() as u64);
}bi-variate function evaluationsUsing the shortint types offers the possibility to evaluate bi-variate functions, or functions that take two ciphertexts as input. This requires choosing a parameter set such that the carry buffer size is at least as large as the message (i.e., PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with X <= Y).Here is a simple code example:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys to compute over Z/2^2Z, with 2 carry bits
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0;
// We use the private client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// Compute the lookup table for the bivariate functions
let acc = server_key.generate_lookup_table_bivariate(|x,y| (x.count_ones()
+ y.count_ones()) as u64 % modulus );
let ct_res = server_key.apply_lookup_table_bivariate(&ct_1, &ct_2, &acc);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_res);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1.count_ones() as u64 + msg2.count_ones() as u64) % modulus);

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintCryptographic parametersAll parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator. Default parameters have an error probability equal to 2−1282^{-128}2−128 when using programmable bootstrapping. This error probability is due to the randomness added at each encryption (see here for more details about the encryption process).Parameters and message precisionshortint comes with sets of parameters that permit the use of the library functionalities securely and efficiently. Each parameter set is associated to the message and carry precisions. Therefore, each key pair is entangled to precision.The user is allowed to choose which set of parameters to use when creating the pair of keys.The difference between the parameter sets is the total amount of space dedicated to the plaintext, how it is split between the message buffer and the carry buffer, and the order in which the keyswitch (KS) and bootstrap (PBS) are computed. The syntax chosen for the name of a parameter is: PARAM_MESSAGE_{number of message bits}_CARRY_{number of carry bits}_{KS_PBS | PBS_KS}. For example, the set of parameters for a message buffer of 5 bits, a carry buffer of 2 bits and where the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrap is PARAM_MESSAGE_5_CARRY_2_KS_PBS.Note that the KS_PBS order should have better performance at the expense of ciphertext size, PBS_KS is the opposite.This example contains keys that are generated to have messages encoded over 2 bits (i.e., computations are done modulus 22=42^2 = 422=4) with 2 bits of carry.The PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameter set is the default shortint parameter set that you can also use through the tfhe::shortint::prelude::DEFAULT_PARAMETERS constant. tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Impact of parameters on the operationsAs shown here, the choice of the parameter set impacts the operations available and their efficiency.Generic bi-variate functions.The computations of bi-variate functions is based on a trick: concatenating two ciphertexts into one. Where the carry buffer is not at least as large as the message buffer, this trick no longer works. In this case, many bi-variate operations, such as comparisons, cannot be correctly computed. The only exception concerns multiplication.Multiplication.In the case of multiplication, two algorithms are implemented: the first one relies on the bi-variate function trick, where the other one is based on the quarter square method. To correctly compute a multiplication, the only requirement is to have at least one bit of carry (i.e., using parameter sets PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with Y>=1). This method is slower than using the other one. Using the smart version of the multiplication automatically chooses which algorithm is used depending on the chosen parameters.User-defined parameter setsIt is possible to define new parameter sets. To do so, it is sufficient to use the function new() or to manually fill the ClassicPBSParameters structure fields.For instance:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{DynamicDistribution, ModulusSwitchType};
fn main() {
// WARNING: might be insecure and/or incorrect
// You can create your own set of parameters
let param = ClassicPBSParameters {

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanCryptographic parametersDefault parametersThe TFHE cryptographic scheme relies on a variant of Regev cryptosystem and is based on a problem so difficult that it is even post-quantum resistant.Some cryptographic parameters will require tuning to ensure both the correctness of the result and the security of the computation.To make it simpler, we've provided two sets of parameters, which ensure correct computations for a certain probability with the standard security of 128 bits. There exists an error probability due to the probabilistic nature of the encryption, which requires adding randomness (noise) following a Gaussian distribution. If this noise is too large, the decryption will not give a correct result. There is a trade-off between efficiency and correctness: generally, using a less efficient parameter set (in terms of computation time) leads to a smaller risk of having an error during homomorphic evaluation.In the two proposed sets of parameters, the only difference lies in this error probability. The default parameter set ensures an error probability of at most 2−642^{-64}2−64 when computing a programmable bootstrapping (i.e., any gates but the not). The other one is closer to the error probability claimed in the original TFHE paper, namely 2−1652^{-165}2−165, but it is up-to-date regarding security requirements.The following array summarizes this:DEFAULT_PARAMETERS2−642^{-64}2−64TFHE_LIB_PARAMETERS2−1652^{-165}2−165User-defined parametersYou can also create your own set of parameters.

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerOperationsThe structure and operations related to integers are described in this section.How an integer is representedIn integer, the encrypted data is split amongst many ciphertexts encrypted with the shortint library. Below is a scheme representing an integer composed by k shortint ciphertexts.This crate implements two ways to represent an integer:the Radix representationthe CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) representationRadix-based integers.The first possibility to represent a large integer is to use a Radix-based decomposition on the plaintexts. Let B∈NB \in \mathbb{N}B∈N be a basis such that the size of BBB is smaller than (or equal to) 4 bits. Then, an integer m∈Nm \in \mathbb{N}m∈N can be written as m=m0+m1∗B+m2∗B2+...m = m_0 + m_1*B + m_2*B^2 + ...m=m0​+m1​∗B+m2​∗B2+..., where each mim_imi​ is strictly smaller than BBB. Each mim_imi​ is then independently encrypted. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.The definition of an integer requires a basis and a number of blocks. These parameters are chosen at key generation. Below, the keys are dedicated to integers encrypting messages over 8 bits, using a basis over 2 bits (i.e., B=22B=2^2B=22) and 4 blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}In this representation, the correctness of operations requires the carries to be propagated throughout the ciphertext. This operation is costly, since it relies on the computation of many programmable bootstrapping operations over shortints.CRT-based integers.The second approach to represent large integers is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this case, the basis BBB is composed of several integers bib_ibi​, such that there are pairwise coprime, and each b_ib\_ib_i has a size smaller than 4 bits. The CRT-based integer are defined modulus ∏bi\prod b_i∏bi​. For an integer mmm, its CRT decomposition is simply defined as m mod b0,m mod b1,...m \bmod{b_0}, m \bmod{b_1}, ...mmodb0​,mmodb1​,.... Each part is then encrypted as a shortint ciphertext. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.In the following example, the chosen basis is B=[2,3,5]B = [2, 3, 5]B=[2,3,5]. The integer is defined modulus 2∗3∗5=302*3*5 = 302∗3∗5=30. There is no need to pre-size the number of blocks since it is determined from the number of values composing the basis. Here, the integer is split over three blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let basis = vec![2, 3, 5];
let cks = CrtClientKey::new(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, basis);
}This representation has many advantages: no carry propagation is required, cleaning the carry buffer of each ciphertext block is enough. This implies that operations can easily be parallelized. It also allows the efficient computation of PBS in the case where the function is CRT-compliant.A variant of the CRT is proposed where each block might be associated to a different key couple. Here, a keychain to the computations is required, but this may result in a performance improvement.List of available operationsThe list of operations available in integer depends on the type of representation:Negation✔️✔️Addition✔️✔️Scalar Addition✔️✔️Subtraction✔️✔️Scalar Subtraction✔️✔️Multiplication✔️✔️Scalar Multiplication✔️✔️Bitwise OR, AND, XOR✔️✔️Equality✔️✔️Left/Right Shift✔️✖️Comparisons <,<=,>, >=✔️✖️Min, Max✔️✖️Types of operationsMuch like shortint, the operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted values.scalar operations take at least one non-encrypted value as input.For example, the addition has both variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (the so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space.checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely.smart: always does the operation, if the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will propagate the carry buffer to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is because the inputs' carry might be cleaned, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value.default: always compute the operation and always clear the carry. Could be slower than smart, but ensure that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use each operation typeLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of already introduced operations. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavor may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise, checked and smart are the best options.As an example, let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and an addition.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
// The carry buffer has been overflowed, the result is not correct
assert_ne!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}During this computation the carry buffer has been overflowed, and the output may be incorrect as all the operations were unchecked.If the same circuit is done but using the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 2;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.checked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar).unwrap();
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2).unwrap();
let result = server_key.checked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
assert!(result.is_err());
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
// Only the scalar multiplication could be done
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar) - msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits the manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be propagated during the computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.smart_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}You must avoid cloning the inputs when calling smart operations to preserve performance. For instance, you SHOULD NOT have these kind of patterns in the code:The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings, as long as only this kind of operation is used. Only the parallelized version of the operations is provided.Using default could slow down computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);

Serialization/Deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerSerialization/DeserializationAs explained in the introduction, some types (Serverkey, Ciphertext) are meant to be shared with the server that does the computations.The easiest way to send these data to a server is to use the serialization and deserialization features. TFHE-rs uses the serde framework, so serde's Serialize and Deserialize are implemented.To be able to serialize our data, a data format needs to be picked. Here, bincode is a good choice, mainly because it is binary format.

# Debugging | TFHE-rs

Debugging | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingDebuggingThis document explains a feature to facilitate debugging.Starting from TFHE-rs 0.5, trivial ciphertexts introduce a new feature to facilitate debugging. This feature supports a debugger, print statements, and faster execution, significantly reducing waiting time and enhancing the development pace of FHE applications.Trivial ciphertexts are not secure. An application released/deployed in production must never receive trivial ciphertext from a client.To use this feature, simply call your circuits/functions with trivially encrypted values that are created using encrypt_trivial(instead of real encryptions that are created using encrypt): tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{set_server_key, generate_keys, ConfigBuilder, FheUint128};
fn mul_all(a: &FheUint128, b: &FheUint128, c: &FheUint128) -> FheUint128 {
// Use the debug format ('{:?}'), if you don't want to unwrap()
// and panic if the value is not a trivial.
println!(
"a: {:?}, b: {:?}, c: {:?}",
a.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
b.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
c.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
);
let tmp = a * b;
println!("a * b = {:?}", tmp.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>());
tmp * c
}
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default().build());
set_server_key(sks);
let a = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(1234u128);
let b = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(4567u128);
let c = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(89101112u128);
// since all inputs are trivially encrypted, this is going to be
// much faster
let result = mul_all(&a, &b, &c);
}This example is going to print:a * b = Ok(5635678)If any input to mul_all is not a trivial ciphertexts, the computations will be done 100% in FHE, and the program will output:a * b = Err(NotTrivialCiphertextError)Using trivial encryptions as input, the example runs in 980 ms on a standard 12-core laptop, compared to 7.5 seconds on a 128-core machine using real encryptions.PreviousGeneric trait boundsNextGPU accelerationLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# PBS statistics | TFHE-rs

PBS statistics | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingPBS statisticsThis document explains how to use the PBS statistics feature in TFHE-rs' shortint API to assess the overall computational intensity in FHE applications.The shortint API now includes a global counter to track the number of Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) executed with the pbs-stats feature. This feature enables precise tracking of PBS executions in a circuit. It helps to estimate the overall compute intensity of FHE code using either the shortint, integer, or High-Level APIs.To know how many PBSes were executed, call get_pbs_count. To reset the PBS count, call reset_pbs_count. You can combine two functions to understand how many PBSes were executed in each part of your code.When combined with the debug mode, this feature allows for quick estimations during iterations on the FHE code.Here is an example of how to use the PBS counter: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::*;
pub fn main() {
// Config and key generation
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Encryption
let a = FheUint32::encrypt(42u32, &cks);
let b = FheUint32::encrypt(16u32, &cks);
// Set the server key
set_server_key(sks);
// Compute and get the PBS count for the 32 bits multiplication
let c = &a * &b;
let mul_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Reset the PBS count, and get the PBS count for a 32 bits bitwise AND
reset_pbs_count();
let d = &a & &b;
let and_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Display the result
println!("mul_32_count: {mul_32_count}");
println!("and_32_count: {and_32_count}");

# Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rs

Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingGeneric trait boundsThis document serves as a practical reference for implementing generic functions in Rust that use operators across mixed references and values. The following explanations help you to understand the trait bounds necessary to handle such operations.Operators such as +, *, >>, and so on are tied to traits in std:::ops. For instance, the + operator corresponds to std::ops::Add. When writing a generic function that uses the + operator, you need to specify std::ops::Add as a trait bound.The trait bound varies slightly depending on whether the left-hand side / right-hand side is an owned value or a reference. The following table shows the different scenarios:T $op TT: $Op<T, Output=T>T $op &TT: for<'a> $Op<&'a T, Output=T>&T $op Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<T, Output=T>&T $op &Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<&'a T, Output=T>The for<'a> syntax refers to the Higher-Rank Trait Bounds(HRTB).Using generic functions allows for clearer input handling, which simplifies the debugging.Example std::ops::{Add, Mul};

You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=stringsStrings are not yet compatible with CompactCiphertextList and CompressedCiphertextListSupported OperationsA variety of common operations are supported for FheAsciiString. These include:Comparisons: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, eq_ignore_caseCase conversion: to_lowercase / to_uppercaseString checks: starts_with / ends_with / containsTrimming: trim_start / trim_end / trimPrefix/suffix operations: strip_prefix / strip_suffixSearch: find / rfindWhen encrypting strings, you can add padding to hide the actual length of strings. The null character (b'\0') is used as the padding. Here is an example:

let padded_string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt_with_padding("tfhe-rs", 3, &cks).unwrap();
// This makes it so the string has 10 chars (adds padding or truncates input as necessary)
let other_string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt_with_fixed_sized("tfhe", 10, &cks).unwrap();
let mut buffer1 = vec![];

# Ternary conditional operations | TFHE-rs

Ternary conditional operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageOperationsTernary conditional operationsThis document details the ternary operations supported by TFHE-rs.The ternary conditional operator execute conditional instructions in the form if cond { choice_if_true } else { choice_if_false }.Ternary operatorselectTernaryThe syntax is encrypted_condition.select(encrypted_choice_if_true, encrypted_choice_if_false). The valid encrypted_condition must be an encryption of 0 or 1.The following example shows how to perform ternary conditional operations: tfhe::prelude::*;

# Parameters | TFHE-rs

Parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore workflowParametersThis document explains how the choice of cryptographic parameters impacts both the security and efficiency of FHE algorithms. The chosen parameters determine the error probability (sometimes referred to failure probability) and overall performance of computations using fully homomorphic encryption. This error probability is due to the noisy nature of FHE computations (see here for more details about the encryption process).All parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator.Default parametersCurrently, the default parameters use blocks that contain 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry - a tweaked uniform (TUniform, defined here) noise distribution, and have a bootstrapping failure probability perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128. These are particularly suitable for applications that need to be secure in the IND-CPA^D model (see here for more details).When using the high-level API of TFHE-rs, you can create a key pair using the default recommended set of parameters. For example: tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations
}These default parameters may be updated with in future releases of TFHE-rs, potentially causing incompatibilities between versions. For production systems, it is therefore recommended to specify a fixed parameter set.Parameters versioning and naming schemeParameter sets are versioned for backward compatibility. This means that each set of parameters can be tied to a specific version of TFHE-rs, so that they remain unchanged and compatible after an upgrade.All parameter sets are stored as variables inside the tfhe::shortint::parameters module, with submodules named after the versions of TFHE-rs in which these parameters where added. For example, parameters added in TFHE-rs v1.0 can be found inside tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_0.The naming convention of these parameters indicates their capabilities. Taking tfhe::parameters::v1_0::V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128 as an example:V1_0: these parameters were introduced in TFHE-rs v1.0MESSAGE_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of messageCARRY_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of carryKS_PBS: the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrapTUNIFORM: the tweaked uniform noise distribution is used2M128: the probability of failure for the bootstrap is 2−1282^{-128}2−128For convenience, aliases are provided for the most used sets of parameters and stored in the module tfhe::shortint::parameters::aliases. Note, however, that these parameters are not stable over time and are always updated to the latest TFHE-rs version. For this reason, they should only be used for prototyping and are not suitable for production use cases.How to choose the parameter setsYou can override the default parameters with the with_custom_parameters(block_parameters) method of the Config object. For example, to use a Gaussian distribution instead of the TUniform one, you can modify your configuration as follows:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::current_params::V1_3_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
fn main() {
let config =
ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(V1_3_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128)
.build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations

# Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rs

Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingCompressing ciphertexts/keysThis document explains the mechanism and steps to compress ciphertext and keys to reduce the storage needed as well as transmission times.Most TFHE-rs entities contain random numbers generated by a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). Since the implemented PRNG is deterministic, storing only the random seed used to generate those numbers preserves all necessary information. When decompressing the entity, using the same PRNG and the same seed will reconstruct the full chain of random values.In TFHE-rs, compressible entities are prefixed with Compressed. For instance, a compressed FheUint256 is declared as CompressedFheUint256.In the following example code, we use the bincode crate dependency to serialize in a binary format and compare serialized sizes.Compressing CiphertextsCompressing ciphertexts at encryption timeThis example shows how to compress a ciphertext encrypting messages over 16 bits: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, CompressedFheUint16};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let clear = 12_837u16;
let compressed = CompressedFheUint16::try_encrypt(clear, &client_key).unwrap();
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed).unwrap().len()
);
let decompressed = compressed.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&decompressed).unwrap().len()
);
let clear_decompressed: u16 = decompressed.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear_decompressed, clear);
}Compression ciphertexts after some homomorphic computationYou can compress ciphertexts at any time, even after performing multiple homomorphic operations.To do so, you need to build a list containing all the ciphertexts that have to be compressed. This list might contain ciphertexts of different types, e.g., FheBool, FheUint32, FheInt64,... There is no constraint regarding the size of the list.There are two possible approaches:Single list: Compressing several ciphertexts into a single list. This generally yields a better compression ratio between output and input sizes;Multiple lists: Using multiple lists. This offers more flexibility, since compression might happen at different times in the code, but could lead to larger outputs.In more details, the optimal ratio is achieved with a list whose size is equal to the lwe_per_glwe field from the CompressionParameters.The following example shows how to compress and decompress a list containing 4 messages: one 32-bits integer, one 64-bit integer, one boolean, and one 2-bit integer.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2,
};
use tfhe::{
set_server_key, CompressedCiphertextList, CompressedCiphertextListBuilder, FheBool,
FheInt64, FheUint16, FheUint2, FheUint32,
};
fn main() {
let config =
tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.enable_compression(COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.build();
let ck = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let sk = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&ck);
set_server_key(sk);
let ct1 = FheUint32::encrypt(17_u32, &ck);
let ct2 = FheInt64::encrypt(-1i64, &ck);
let ct3 = FheBool::encrypt(false, &ck);
let ct4 = FheUint2::encrypt(3u8, &ck);
let compressed_list = CompressedCiphertextListBuilder::new()
.push(ct1)
.push(ct2)
.push(ct3)
.push(ct4)
.build()
.unwrap();
let serialized = bincode::serialize(&compressed_list).unwrap();
println!("Serialized size: {} bytes", serialized.len());
let compressed_list: CompressedCiphertextList = bincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
let a: FheUint32 = compressed_list.get(0).unwrap().unwrap();
let b: FheInt64 = compressed_list.get(1).unwrap().unwrap();
let c: FheBool = compressed_list.get(2).unwrap().unwrap();
let d: FheUint2 = compressed_list.get(3).unwrap().unwrap();
let a: u32 = a.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(a, 17);
let b: i64 = b.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(b, -1);
let c = c.decrypt(&ck);
assert!(!c);
let d: u8 = d.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(d, 3);
// Out of bound index
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheBool>(4).unwrap().is_none());
// Incorrect type
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheInt64>(0).is_err());
// Correct type but wrong number of bits
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheUint16>(0).is_err());
}Compressing keysCompressing server keysThis example shows how to compress the server keys:use tfhe::{
set_server_key, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8,
};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let cks = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_sks = CompressedServerKey::new(&cks);
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed_sks).unwrap().len()
);
let sks = compressed_sks.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&sks).unwrap().len()
);
set_server_key(sks);
let clear_a = 12u8;
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(clear_a, &cks).unwrap();
let c = a + 234u8;
let decrypted: u8 = c.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a.wrapping_add(234));
}
Compressed public keysThis example shows how to compress the classical public keys:It is not currently recommended to use the CompressedPublicKey to encrypt ciphertexts without first decompressing them. If the resulting PublicKey is too large to fit in memory, it may result in significant slowdowns.This issue has been identified and will be addressed in future releases.use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, CompressedPublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let compressed_public_key = CompressedPublicKey::new(&client_key);
println!("compressed size : {}", bincode::serialize(&compressed_public_key).unwrap().len());
let public_key = compressed_public_key.decompress();
println!("decompressed size: {}", bincode::serialize(&public_key).unwrap().len());
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(213u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear, 213u8);
}Compressed compact public keyThis example shows how to use compressed compact public keys:use tfhe::{
generate_keys, CompactCiphertextList, CompressedCompactPublicKey,
ConfigBuilder, FheUint8,
};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(
tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128,

let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let public_key_compressed = CompressedCompactPublicKey::new(&client_key);
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&public_key_compressed).unwrap().len()
);
let public_key = public_key_compressed.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&public_key).unwrap().len()
);
let compact_list = CompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(255u8)
.build();
let expanded = compact_list.expand().unwrap();
let a: FheUint8 = expanded.get(0).unwrap().unwrap();

Data versioning | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingData versioningData versioning and backward compatibilityThis document explains how to save and load versioned data using the data versioning feature.Starting from v0.6.4, TFHE-rs supports versioned data types. This allows you to store data and load it in the future without compatibility concerns. This feature is done by the tfhe-versionable crate.This versioning scheme is compatible with all the data formats supported by serde.Saving and loading versioned dataTo use the versioning feature, wrap your types in their versioned equivalents before serialization using the versionize method. You can load serialized data with the unversionize function, even in newer versions of TFHE-rs where the data types might evolve. The unversionize function manages any necessary data type upgrades, ensuring compatibility.

}VersionizeCalling .versionize() on a value will add versioning tags. This is done recursively so all the subtypes that compose it are versioned too. Under the hood, it converts the value into an enum where each version of a type is represented by a new variant. The returned object can be serialized using serde: bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &versioned_client_key).unwrap();UnversionizeThe Type::unversionize() function takes a versioned value, upgrades it to the latest version of its type and removes the version tags. To do that, it matches the version in the versioned enum and eventually apply a conversion function that upgrades it to the most recent version. The resulting value can then be used inside TFHE-rs let loaded_client_key =
ClientKey::unversionize(versioned_client_key).unwrap();Breaking changesWhen possible, data will be upgraded automatically without any kind of interaction. However, some changes might need information that are only known by the user of the library. These are called data breaking changes.

# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs

*Source: tfhe-rs/1.3/fhe-computation/data-handling/serialization.html*

Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingSerialization/deserializationThis document explains the serialization and deserialization features that are useful to send data to a server to perform the computations.Safe serialization/deserializationWhen dealing with sensitive types, it's important to implement safe serialization and safe deserialization functions to prevent runtime errors and enhance security. TFHE-rs provide easy to use functions for this purpose, such as safe_serialize, safe_deserialize and safe_deserialize_conformant.Here is a basic example on how to use it:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, safe_serialize};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
// The last argument is the max allowed size for the serialized buffer
safe_serialize(&server_key, &mut buffer, 1 << 30).unwrap();
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}The safe deserialization must take the output of a safe-serialization as input. During the process, the following validation occurs:Type match: deserializing type A from a serialized type B raises an error indicating "On deserialization, expected type A, got type B".Version compatibility: data serialized in previous versions of TFHE-rs are automatically upgraded to the latest version using the data versioning feature.Parameter compatibility: deserializing an object of type A with one set of crypto parameters from an object of type A with another set of crypto parameters raises an error indicating "Deserialized object of type A not conformant with given parameter set"If both parameter sets have the same LWE dimension for ciphertexts, a ciphertext from param 1 may not fail this deserialization check with param 2.This check can't distinguish ciphertexts/server keys from independent client keys with the same parameters.This check is meant to prevent runtime errors in server homomorphic operations by checking that server keys and ciphertexts are compatible with the same parameter set.You can use the standalone is_conformant method to check parameter compatibility. Besides, the safe_deserialize_conformant function includes the parameter compatibility check, and the safe_deserialize function does not include the compatibility check.Size limit: both serialization and deserialization processes expect a size limit (measured in bytes) for the serialized data:On serialization, an error is raised if the serialized output exceeds the specific limit.On deserialization, an error is raised if the serialized input exceeds the specific limit.This feature aims to gracefully return an error in case of an attacker trying to cause an out-of-memory error on deserialization.Here is a more complete example:
use tfhe::conformance::ParameterSetConformant;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_serialize, safe_deserialize_conformant};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128};
use tfhe::conformance::ListSizeConstraint;
use tfhe::{
generate_keys, FheUint8, CompactCiphertextList, FheUint8ConformanceParams,
CompactPublicKey, ConfigBuilder, CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams
};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
let params_2 = PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
assert_ne!(params_1, params_2);
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let conformance_params_1 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_1);
let conformance_params_2 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_2);
let public_key = CompactPublicKey::new(&client_key);
let msg = 27u8;
let ct = FheUint8::try_encrypt(msg, &client_key).unwrap();
assert!(ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_1));
assert!(!ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_2));
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&ct, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
assert!(safe_deserialize_conformant::<FheUint8>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_2)
.is_err());
let ct2: FheUint8 = safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_1)
.unwrap();
let dec: u8 = ct2.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(msg, dec);
// Example with a compact list:
let msgs = [27, 188u8];
let mut builder = CompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key);
builder.extend(msgs.iter().copied());
let compact_list = builder.build();
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&compact_list, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
let conformance_params = CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams {
shortint_params: params_1.to_shortint_conformance_param(),
num_elements_constraint: ListSizeConstraint::exact_size(2),
};
safe_deserialize_conformant::<CompactCiphertextList>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params)
.unwrap();
}The safe serialization and deserialization use bincode internally.To selectively disable some of the features of the safe serialization, you can use SerializationConfig/DeserializationConfig builders. For example, it is possible to disable the data versioning:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, SerializationConfig};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
SerializationConfig::new(1 << 30).disable_versioning().serialize_into(&server_key, &mut buffer).unwrap();
// You will still be able to load this item with `safe_deserialize_conformant`, but only using the current version of TFHE-rs
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}Serialization/deserialization using serdeTFHE-rs uses the Serde framework and implements Serde's Serialize and Deserialize traits.This allows you to serialize into any data format supported by serde. However, this is a more bare bone approach as none of the checks described in the previous section will be performed for you.In the following example, we use bincode for its binary format:
[dependencies]
# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs
tfhe = { version = "~1.3.3", features = ["integer"] }
bincode = "1.3.3"
use std::io::Cursor;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, ServerKey, generate_keys, set_server_key, FheUint8};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>{
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
let value_1 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg1, &client_key);
let value_2 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg2, &client_key);
// Prepare to send data to the server
// The ClientKey is _not_ sent
let mut serialized_data = Vec::new();
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &server_key)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_1)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_2)?;
// Simulate sending serialized data to a server and getting
// back the serialized result
let serialized_result = server_function(&serialized_data)?;
let result: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize(&serialized_result)?;
let output: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(output, msg1 + msg2);
Ok(())
}
fn server_function(serialized_data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut serialized_data = Cursor::new(serialized_data);

# Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rs

Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresEncrypted pseudo random valuesThis document explains the mechanism and steps to generate an oblivious encrypted random value using only server keys.The goal is to give to the server the possibility to generate a random value, which will be obtained in an encrypted format and will remain unknown to the server. The implementation is based on this article.This is possible through two methods on FheUint and FheInt:generate_oblivious_pseudo_random which return an integer taken uniformly in the full integer range ([0; 2^N[ for a FheUintN and [-2^(N-1); 2^(N-1)[ for a FheIntN).generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded which return an integer taken uniformly in [0; 2^random_bits_count[. For a FheUintN, we must have random_bits_count <= N. For a FheIntN, we must have random_bits_count <= N - 1.Both methods functions take a seed Seed as input, which could be any u128 value. They both rely on the use of the usual server key. The output is reproducible, i.e., the function is deterministic from the inputs: assuming the same hardware, seed and server key, this function outputs the same random encrypted value.Here is an example of the usage: tfhe::prelude::FheDecrypt;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8, FheInt8, Seed};
pub fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let random_bits_count = 3;
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(dec_result < (1 << random_bits_count));
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(dec_result < (1 << random_bits_count));

# Noise squashing | TFHE-rs

Noise squashing | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresNoise squashingIn the context of confidential blockchain protocols, like the Zama protocol, for security reasons the threshold decryption requires to hide the intrinsic noise of FHE operations. This can be achieved by the MPC nodes by adding large amounts of random noise before they perform the actual decryption. In order to have enough room for that large noise that needs to be added before decryption, the noise squashing operation is performed.TFHE-rs' High Level API provides APIs to do just that, here is how one would use those primitives: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
NOISE_SQUASHING_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
};
use tfhe::*;
// We use an identity function to verify FHE operations, it is fine in this context
#[allow(clippy::eq_op)]
pub fn main() {
// Configure computations enabling the noise squashing capability.
let config =
ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128)
.enable_noise_squashing(NOISE_SQUASHING_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128)
.build();
// Generate the keys
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Set the key once for our various examples
set_server_key(sks);
// FheUint32 case
let clear: u32 = 42;
// Encrypt
let enc = FheUint32::encrypt(clear, &cks);
// Simulate a bitand on the blockchain
let bitand = &enc & &enc;
// Perform the noise squashing
let squashed = bitand.squash_noise().unwrap();
// We don't perform the noise flooding, but here verify that the noise squashing preserves our
// data
let recovered: u32 = squashed.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(clear, recovered);
// FheInt16 case
let clear: i16 = -42;
let enc = FheInt10::encrypt(clear, &cks);
let bitand = &enc & &enc;
let squashed = bitand.squash_noise().unwrap();
let recovered: i16 = squashed.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(clear, recovered);
// Boolean case
for clear in [false, true] {

let bitand = &enc & &enc;
let squashed = bitand.squash_noise().unwrap();
let recovered: bool = squashed.decrypt(&cks);

}
}
CompressionLike regular ciphertexts, squashed noise ciphertexts can be stored into a list and compressed to reduce their size.To do that, use CompressedSquashedNoiseCiphertextList::builder:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{

.enable_noise_squashing_compression(NOISE_SQUASHING_COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128)
.build();
// Generate the keys
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Set the key once for our various examples
set_server_key(sks);
// Encrypt some values
let clear_a: i32 = -42;
let clear_b: u32 = 1025;
let clear_c = false;
let a = FheInt32::encrypt(clear_a, &cks);
let b = FheUint32::encrypt(clear_b, &cks);
let c = FheBool::encrypt(clear_c, &cks);
// Squash the noise
let squashed_a = a.squash_noise().unwrap();
let squashed_b = b.squash_noise().unwrap();
let squashed_c = c.squash_noise().unwrap();
// Store ciphertexts into a list and compress them

# Overflow detection | TFHE-rs

Overflow detection | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresOverflow detectionThis document explains how TFHE-rs implements specific operations to detect overflows in computations.The mechanism of detecting overflow consists in returning an encrypted flag with a specific ciphertext that reflects the state of the computation. When an overflow occurs, this flag is set to true. Since the server is not able to evaluate this encrypted value, the client has to check the flag value when decrypting to determine if an overflow has happened.These operations might be slower than their non-overflow-detecting equivalent, so they are not enabled by default. To use them, you must explicitly call specific operators. At the moment, only additions, subtractions, and multiplications are supported. We plan to add more operations in future releases.Here's the list of operations supported along with their symbol:Addoverflow_addBinarySuboverflow_subBinaryMuloverflow_mulBinaryThe usage of these operations is similar to the standard ones. The key difference is in the decryption process, as shown in following example:
//
// * The operation is modular, i.e on overflow the result wraps around.
// * On overflow the [FheBool] is true, otherwise false
use tfhe::prelude::*;

# Public key encryption | TFHE-rs

Public key encryption | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresPublic key encryptionThis document explains public key encryption and provides instructions for 2 methods.Public key encryption refers to the cryptographic paradigm where the encryption key can be publicly distributed, whereas the decryption key remains secret to the owner. This differs from the usual case where the same secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. In TFHE-rs, there are two methods for public key encryptions:Classical public key: the first method involves the public key containing many encryptions of zero, as detailed in Guide to Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the [Discretized] Torus, Appendix A.Compact public key: the second method is based on the paper TFHE Public-Key Encryption Revisited, allowing for significantly smaller key sizes compared to the first method.Public keys can also be compressed to reduce size.Classical public keyThis example shows how to use classical public keys. tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, PublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(255u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear, 255u8);
}Compact public keyThis example shows how to use compact public keys. The main difference is in the ConfigBuilder where the parameter set has been changed.For more information on using compact public keys to encrypt data and generate a zero-knowledge proof of correct encryption at the same time, see the guide on ZK proofs.use tfhe::{

# Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rs

Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresMulti-threading with Rayon crateThis document describes how to use Rayon for parallel processing in TFHE-rs, detailing configurations for single and multi-client applications with code examples.Rayon is a popular Rust crate that simplifies writing multi-threaded code. You can use Rayon to write multi-threaded TFHE-rs code. However, due to the specifications of Rayon and TFHE-rs, certain setups are necessary.Single-client applicationThe problemThe high-level API requires to call set_server_key on each thread where computations need to be done. So a first attempt to use Rayon with TFHE-rs might look like this: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
// set_server_key in each closure as they might be
// running in different threads
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
}However, due to Rayon's work-stealing mechanism and TFHE-rs' internals, this may create BorrowMutError.Working exampleThe correct way is to call rayon::broadcast as follows:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
// set the server key in all of the rayon's threads so that
// we won't need to do it later
rayon::broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks.clone()));
// Set the server key in the main thread
set_server_key(sks);
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
let a: u8 = a.decrypt(&cks);
let b: u8 = b.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(a, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b, 6u8);
}Multi-client applicationsFor applications that need to operate concurrently on data from different clients and require each client to use multiple threads, you need to create separate Rayon thread pools:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks1, sks1) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks1),
];
let ys1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks1),
];
let (cks2, sks2) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(100u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(200u8, &cks2),
];
let ys2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(103u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(204u8, &cks2),
];
let client_1_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
let client_2_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(2).build().unwrap();
client_1_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));
client_2_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks2.clone()));
let ((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) = rayon::join(|| {
client_1_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs1[0] + &ys1[0]
},
|| {
&xs1[1] + &ys1[1]
}
)
})
}, || {
client_2_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs2[0] + &ys2[0]
},
|| {
&xs2[1] + &ys2[1]
}
)
})
});
let a1: u8 = a1.decrypt(&cks1);
let b1: u8 = b1.decrypt(&cks1);
assert_eq!(a1, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b1, 6u8);
let a2: u8 = a2.decrypt(&cks2);
let b2: u8 = b2.decrypt(&cks2);
assert_eq!(a2, 203u8);
assert_eq!(b2, 148u8);
}This can be useful if you have some rust #[test], see the example below:#[test]
fn test_1() {
let pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));

})
}

For example, when computing the sum of a list of ciphertexts, you typically initialize the sum variable to 0.Instead of asking the client to send an actual encrypted zero, the server can use a trivial encryption.

This technique is derived from Libert’s work.You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=zk-pok when building TFHE-rs.To use this feature, you must first generate a CRS (Common Reference String). The CRS is a piece of cryptographic data that is necessary to ensure the security of zero-knowledge proofs. The CRS should be generated in advance and shared between all the clients and the server. A CRS can be reused for multiple encryptions with the same parameters.Once the CRS is generated, using zero-knowledge proofs is straightforward: during encryption, the client generates the proof, and the server validates it before performing any homomorphic computations.Note that you need to use dedicated parameters for the compact public key encryption. This helps to reduce the size of encrypted data and speed up the zero-knowledge proof computation.The following example shows how a client can encrypt and prove a ciphertext, and how a server can verify and compute the ciphertext: rand::prelude::*;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};
pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Indicate which parameters to use for the Compact Public Key encryption
let cpk_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_PKE_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// And parameters allowing to keyswitch/cast to the computation parameters.
let casting_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_KEYSWITCH_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Enable the dedicated parameters on the config
let config = tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params)
.use_dedicated_compact_public_key_parameters((cpk_params, casting_params)).build();
// The CRS should be generated in an offline phase then shared to all clients and the server
let crs = CompactPkeCrs::from_config(config, 64).unwrap();
// Then use TFHE-rs as usual
let client_key = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let server_key = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&client_key);
let public_key = tfhe::CompactPublicKey::try_new(&client_key).unwrap();
// This can be left empty, but if provided allows to tie the proof to arbitrary data
let metadata = [b'T', b'F', b'H', b'E', b'-', b'r', b's'];
let clear_a = rng.gen::<u64>();
let clear_b = rng.gen::<u64>();
let proven_compact_list = tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(clear_a)
.push(clear_b)
.build_with_proof_packed(&crs, &metadata, ZkComputeLoad::Verify)?;
// Server side
let result = {
set_server_key(server_key);
// Verify the ciphertexts
let expander =
proven_compact_list.verify_and_expand(&crs, &public_key, &metadata)?;
let a: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(0)?.unwrap();
let b: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(1)?.unwrap();
a + b
};
// Back on the client side
let a_plus_b: u64 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(a_plus_b, clear_a.wrapping_add(clear_b));
Ok(())
}Performance can be improved by setting lto="fat" in Cargo.tomllto = "fat"and by building the code for the native CPU architecture and in release mode, e.g. by calling RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release.You can choose a more costly proof with ZkComputeLoad::Proof, which has a faster verification time. Alternatively, you can select ZkComputeLoad::Verify for a faster proof and slower verification.Scheme versionThe ZK scheme used to generate and verify proofs is available in two versions:ZKV1: This version is close to the original paper from Libert.ZKV2: Differing from the paper, this version provides better performance for provers and verifiers.TFHE-rs selects automatically the scheme to use based on the encryption parameters during the CRS generation. With default parameters, ZKV2 is selected.The following example shows how to generate a CRS and proofs for ZKV1. Compared to the previous example, only the parameters are changed:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};

# Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringThis tutorial demonstrates how to build your own data type that represents an ASCII string in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) by implementing to_lower and to_upper functions.Since version 0.11, TFHE-rs has introduced the strings feature, which provides an easy to use FHE strings API. See the fhe strings guide for more information.An ASCII character is stored in 7 bits. In this tutorial, we use the FheUint8 to store an encrypted ASCII:The uppercase letters are in the range [65, 90]The lowercase letters are in the range [97, 122]The relationship between uppercase and lowercase letters is defined as follows:lower_case = upper_case + UP_LOW_DISTANCEupper_case = lower_case - UP_LOW_DISTANCEWhere UP_LOW_DISTANCE = 32Types and methodsThis type stores the encrypted characters as a Vec<FheUint8> to implement case conversion functions.To use the FheUint8 type, enable the integer feature:
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.3.3", features = ["integer"] }The MyFheString::encrypt function performs data validation to ensure the input string contains only ASCII characters.In FHE operations, direct branching on encrypted values is not possible. However, you can evaluate a boolean condition to obtain the desired outcome. Here is an example to check and convert the 'char' to a lowercase without using a branch:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
if c > 64 && c < 91 {
c + UP_LOW_DISTANCE
} else {
c
}
}You can remove the branch this way:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
c + ((c > 64) as u8 & (c < 91) as u8) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}This method can adapt to operations on homomorphic integers:
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::FheUint8;
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}Full example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ClientKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8};
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
struct MyFheString {
bytes: Vec<FheUint8>,
}
fn to_upper(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c - FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(96) & c.lt(123)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
impl MyFheString {
fn encrypt(string: &str, client_key: &ClientKey) -> Self {
assert!(
string.is_ascii(),
"The input string must only contain ascii letters"
);
let fhe_bytes: Vec<FheUint8> = string
.bytes()
.map(|b| FheUint8::encrypt(b, client_key))
.collect();
Self { bytes: fhe_bytes }
}
fn decrypt(&self, client_key: &ClientKey) -> String {
let ascii_bytes: Vec<u8> = self
.bytes
.iter()
.map(|fhe_b| fhe_b.decrypt(client_key))
.collect();
String::from_utf8(ascii_bytes).unwrap()
}
fn to_upper(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_upper).collect(),
}
}
fn to_lower(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_lower).collect(),
}
}
}
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string = MyFheString::encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key);
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_upper();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lower();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");
}Using TFHE-rs strings featureThis code can be greatly simplified by using the strings feature from TFHE-rs.First, add the feature in your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.3.3", features = ["strings"] }The FheAsciiString type allows to simply do homomorphic case changing of encrypted strings (and much more!):use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheAsciiString};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string =
FheAsciiString::try_encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key).unwrap();
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_uppercase();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lowercase();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");

# SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rs

SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSHA256 with Boolean APIThis tutorial guides you to convert a regular SHA-256 function to its homomorphic version, with considerations of optimal performances. You will learn:The basics of the SHA-256 function.The steps to implement SHA-256 homomorphically.SHA-256 basicsFirst, you need to implement the SHA-256 function. You can find the official specification for SHA-256 here. We summarize the three key aspects of SHA-256 outlined in the document:PaddingThe SHA-256 function processes the input data in blocks or chunks of 512 bits. Before performing the hash computations, prepare the data as follows:Append a single "1" bitAppend "0" bits until exactly 64 bits remain to make the message length a multiple of 512Append the last 64 bits as a binary encoding of the original input lengthIn this diagram, the numbers on the top represent the length of the padded input at each position. The formula L+1+k+64 ensures that the length reaches a multiple of 512, matching the required length of the padded input.Operations and functionsWe will use bitwise AND, XOR, NOT, addition modulo 2^32, the Rotate Right (ROTR) and Shift Right (SHR) operations as building blocks for functions inside the SHA-256 computation. These operations all use 32-bit words and produce new words.We combine these operations inside the sigma (with 4 variations), Ch, and Maj functions. When changing SHA-256 to the homomorphic computation, we will mainly change the code of each operation.Here is the definition of each function:Maj(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) XOR (y AND z)
Σ0(x) = ROTR-2(x) XOR ROTR-13(x) XOR ROTR-22(x)
Σ1(x) = ROTR-6(x) XOR ROTR-11(x) XOR ROTR-25(x)
σ0(x) = ROTR-7(x) XOR ROTR-18(x) XOR SHR-3(x)
σ1(x) = ROTR-17(x) XOR ROTR-19(x) XOR SHR-10(x)We simplify Maj using the Boolean distributive law: (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) = x AND (y XOR z), as shown below:We simplify Ch using a single bitwise multiplexer. Here's the truth table of the Ch expression.00000011010001111000101011011111This table shows that the result equals to z when x = 0, and the result equals to y when x = 1, which means if x {y} else {z}. Hence we can replace the 4 bitwise operations of Ch by a single bitwise multiplexer.All these operations can be evaluated homomorphically:ROTR and SHR: They can be evaluated by changing the index of each ecrypted bit of the word without using any homomorphic operation.Bitwise AND, XOR and multiplexer: They can be computed homomorphicallyAddition modulo 2^32: It can be broken down into boolean homomorphic operations.SHA-256 computationThe SHA-256 function processes data in 512-bit chunks. Here is what happens during computation:The 512-bit chunk is computed into 16 words, each containing 32 bits.Another 48 words are computed using the previous function.After computing the 64 words, within the same chunk, a compression loop will compute a hash value (8 32-bit words) using the previous functions and some constants to mix everything up.This entire process iterate through each 512-bit chunk of your data.When we finish the last chunk iteration, the resulting hash values will be the output of the SHA-256 function.Here is an example of this function using arrays of 32 bools to represent words:
// Initialize hash values with constant values
let mut hash: [[bool; 32]; 8] = [
hex_to_bools(0x6a09e667), hex_to_bools(0xbb67ae85),
hex_to_bools(0x3c6ef372), hex_to_bools(0xa54ff53a),
hex_to_bools(0x510e527f), hex_to_bools(0x9b05688c),
hex_to_bools(0x1f83d9ab), hex_to_bools(0x5be0cd19),
];
let chunks = padded_input.chunks(512);
for chunk in chunks {
let mut w = [[false; 32]; 64];
// Copy first 16 words from current chunk
for i in 0..16 {
w[i].copy_from_slice(&chunk[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32]);
}
// Compute the other 48 words
for i in 16..64 {
w[i] = add(add(add(sigma1(&w[i - 2]), w[i - 7]), sigma0(&w[i - 15])), w[i - 16]);
}
let mut a = hash[0];
let mut b = hash[1];
let mut c = hash[2];
let mut d = hash[3];
let mut e = hash[4];
let mut f = hash[5];
let mut g = hash[6];
let mut h = hash[7];
// Compression loop, each iteration uses a specific constant from K
for i in 0..64 {
let temp1 = add(add(add(add(h, ch(&e, &f, &g)), w[i]), hex_to_bools(K[i])), sigma_upper_case_1(&e));
let temp2 = add(sigma_upper_case_0(&a), maj(&a, &b, &c));
h = g;
g = f;
f = e;
e = add(d, temp1);
d = c;
c = b;
b = a;
a = add(temp1, temp2);
}
hash[0] = add(hash[0], a);
hash[1] = add(hash[1], b);
hash[2] = add(hash[2], c);
hash[3] = add(hash[3], d);
hash[4] = add(hash[4], e);
hash[5] = add(hash[5], f);
hash[6] = add(hash[6], g);
hash[7] = add(hash[7], h);
}
// Concatenate the final hash values to produce a 256-bit hash
let mut output = [false; 256];
for i in 0..8 {
output[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32].copy_from_slice(&hash[i]);
}

}Homomorphic SHA-256 on encrypted dataTo convert SHA-256 to a homomorphic version, you can replace each bit of padded_input with a fully homomorphic encryption of the same bit value and operate on the encrypted value using homomorphic operations.While the structure of the SHA-256 function remains the same, there are some important considerations in the code:The function signature and the borrowing rules should adapt to the ciphertext type (representing the encrypted bits).Implementing SHA-256 operations with homomorphic encryption uses homomorphic boolean operations internally.Homomorphic operations on encrypted data can be very expensive. Consider these options for better speed:Remove unnecessary use of homomorphic operations and maximize parallelization.Simplify the code with Rayon crate that parallelizes iterators and manages threads efficiently.The final code is available here.Now let's dive into details of each SHA256 operation.Rotate Right and Shift RightRotate Right and Shift Right can be evaluated by changing the position of each encrypted bit in the word, requiring no homomorphic operations. Here is the implementation: let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result
}
fn shift_right(x: &[Ciphertext; 32], n: usize, sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result[..n].fill_with(|| sk.trivial_encrypt(false));
result
}Bitwise XOR, AND, MultiplexerTo implement these operations, we will use the xor, and mux methods from the TFHE-rs library to perform each boolean operation homomorphically.For better efficiency, we can parallelize the homomorphic computations because we operate bitwise. It means that we can homomorphically XOR the bits at index 0 of two words using one thread while XORing the bits at index 1 using another thread, and so on. This approach allows for the computation of bitwise operations using up to 32 concurrent threads, corresponding to the 32-bit words used.Here is the implementation of the bitwise homomorphic XOR operation. The par_iter and par_iter_mut methods create a parallel iterator that we use to compute each XOR efficiently. The other two bitwise operations are implemented in the same way. let mut result = a.clone();
result.par_iter_mut()
.zip(a.par_iter().zip(b.par_iter()))
.for_each(|(dst, (lhs, rhs))| *dst = sk.xor(lhs, rhs));
result
}Addition modulo 2^32This might be the trickiest operation to efficiently implement in a homomorphic manner. A naive implementation could use the Ripple Carry Adder algorithm, which is straightforward but cannot be parallelized because each step depends on the previous one.A better choice is to use Carry Lookahead Adder, which allows us to use the parallelized AND and XOR bitwise operations. With this design, our adder is around 50% faster than the Ripple Carry Adder. let propagate = xor(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
let generate = and(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise AND
let carry = compute_carry(&propagate, &generate, sk);
let sum = xor(&propagate, &carry, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
sum
}
fn compute_carry(propagate: &[Ciphertext; 32], generate: &[Ciphertext; 32], sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut carry = trivial_bools(&[false; 32], sk);
carry[31] = sk.trivial_encrypt(false);
for i in (0..31).rev() {
carry[i] = sk.or(&generate[i + 1], &sk.and(&propagate[i + 1], &carry[i + 1]));
}
carry
}To further optimize performance, we use parallel prefix algorithms to parallelize the function that computes the carry signals. These algorithms involve more (homomorphic) boolean operations and their parallel nature speeds up the processing. We have implemented the Brent-Kung and Ladner-Fischer algorithms with different tradeoffs:Brent-Kung has the least amount of boolean operations we could find (140 when using grey cells, for 32-bit numbers), which makes it suitable when we can't process many operations concurrently and fast. Our results confirm that it's indeed faster than both the sequential algorithm and Ladner-Fischer when run on regular computers.On the other hand, Ladner-Fischer performs more boolean operations (209 using grey cells) than Brent-Kung, but they are performed in larger batches. Hence we can compute more operations in parallel and finish earlier, but we need more fast threads available or they will slow down the carry signals computation. Ladner-Fischer can be suitable when using cloud-based computing services, which offer many high-speed threads.Our implementation uses Brent-Kung by default, but you can enable Ladner-Fischer by using the --ladner-fischer command line argument.For more information about parallel prefix adders, you can read this paper or this other paper.Finally, with all these SHA-256 operations working homomorphically, our functions will be homomomorphic as well along with the whole SHA-256 function (after adapting the code to work with the Ciphertext type).More parallel processingLet's talk about other performance improvements we can make before we finish.In the main sha256_fhe, you can perform some functions in parallel. For example, in the compression loop, temp1 and temp2 can be computed in parallel by using the rayon::join() function when there is a CPU available. The two temporary values in the compression loop are the result of multiple additions, so you can use nested calls to rayon::join() to parallelize more operations.Another way to speed up consecutive additions would be using the Carry Save Adder, a very efficient adder that takes 3 numbers and returns a sum and a carry sequence. If our inputs are A, B, and C, we can construct a CSA with our previously implemented Maj function and the bitwise XOR operation as follows:Sum = A XOR B XOR CBy chaining CSAs, we can input the sum and carry from a preceding stage along with another number into a new CSA. Finally, to get the result of the additions we add the sum and carry sequences using a conventional adder. In the end, we are performing the same number of additions, but some of them are now CSAs, speeding up the process. Below is the illustration of this process in the temp1 and temp2 computations. || {
let ((sum, carry), s1) = rayon::join(
|| {
let ((sum, carry), ch) = rayon::join(
|| csa(&h, &w[i], &trivial_bools(&hex_to_bools(K[i]), sk), sk),
|| ch(&e, &f, &g, sk),
);
csa(&sum, &carry, &ch, sk)
},
|| sigma_upper_case_1(&e, sk)
);
let (sum, carry) = csa(&sum, &carry, &s1, sk);
add(&sum, &carry, sk)
},
|| {
add(&sigma_upper_case_0(&a, sk), &maj(&a, &b, &c, sk), sk)
},
);The first closure of the outer call to join will return temp1 and the second temp2.Inside the first outer closure, we call join recursively until we add the value h, the current word w[i], and the current constant K[i] by using the CSA, while potentially computing the ch function in parallel. Then we take the sum, carry, and ch values and add them again using the CSA.All this is done while potentially computing the sigma_upper_case_1 function. Finally we input the previous sum, carry, and sigma values to the CSA and perform the final addition with add. Once again, this is done while potentially computing sigma_upper_case_0 and maj and adding them to get temp2, in the second outer closure.With these types of changes, we finally get a homomorphic SHA256 function that doesn't leave unused computational resources.How to use SHA256_boolFirst, use the --release flag when running the program. Considering the implementation of encrypt_bools and decrypt_bools, the use of SHA-256 will be as follows: let matches = Command::new("Homomorphic sha256")
.arg(Arg::new("ladner_fischer")
.long("ladner-fischer")
.help("Use the Ladner Fischer parallel prefix algorithm for additions")
.action(ArgAction::SetTrue))
.get_matches();
// If set using the command line flag "--ladner-fischer" this algorithm will be used in additions
let ladner_fischer: bool = matches.get_flag("ladner_fischer");
// INTRODUCE INPUT FROM STDIN
let mut input = String::new();
println!("Write input to hash:");
io::stdin()
.read_line(&mut input)
.expect("Failed to read line");
input = input.trim_end_matches('\n').to_string();
println!("You entered: \"{}\"", input);
// CLIENT PADS DATA AND ENCRYPTS IT
let (ck, sk) = gen_keys();
let padded_input = pad_sha256_input(&input);
let encrypted_input = encrypt_bools(&padded_input, &ck);
// SERVER COMPUTES OVER THE ENCRYPTED PADDED DATA
println!("Computing the hash");

let output = decrypt_bools(&encrypted_output, &ck);
let outhex = bools_to_hex(output);
println!("{}", outhex);
}We can supply the data to hash using a file instead of the command line by using stdin . For example, if the file input.txt is in the same directory as the project, we can use the following shell command after building with cargo build --release:The program accepts hexadecimal inputs. The input must start with "0x" and contain only valid hex digits, otherwise it will be interpreted as text.Finally， padding is performed on the client side. This has the advantage of hiding the exact length of the input content from the server, thus avoiding the server extracting information from the length, even though the content is fully encrypted.It is also feasible to perform padding on the server side. The padding function would take the encrypted input and pad it with trivial bit encryptions. We can then integrate the padding function into the sha256_fhe function computed by the server.PreviousHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringNextAll tutorialsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Security and cryptography | TFHE-rs

Security and cryptography | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSecurity and cryptographyThis document introduces the cryptographic concepts of the scheme of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) and the security considerations of TFHE-rs.For an in-depth description of TFHE you can read the TFHE-rs handbook.TFHETFHE-rs is a cryptographic library that implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the TFHE scheme. You should understand the basics of TFHE to consider its limitations, such as:The precision: TFHE has limitations on the number of bits used to represent plaintext values.The execution time: TFHE operations are slower than native operations due to their complexity.LWE ciphertextsTFHE-rs primarily utilizes Learning With Errors (LWE) ciphertexts. The LWE problem forms the basis of TFHE's security and is considered resistant to quantum attacks.An LWE Ciphertext is a collection of 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integers. Before encrypting a message in an LWE ciphertext, you first need to encode it as a plaintext by shifting the message to the most significant bits of the unsigned integer type used.Then, you add a small random value called noise to the least significant bits. This noise is crucial in ensuring the security of the ciphertext.plaintext=(Δ∗m)+eplaintext = (\Delta * m) + eplaintext=(Δ∗m)+em∈Zpm \in \mathbb{Z}_pm∈Zp​To get a ciphertext from a plaintext, you must encrypt the plaintext using a secret key.An LWE secret key is a list of n random integers: S=(s0,...,sn−1)S = (s_0, ..., s_{n-1})S=(s0​,...,sn−1​). nnn is called the LweDimensionLweDimensionLweDimensionAn LWE ciphertext is composed of two parts:The mask (a0,...,an−1)(a_0, ..., a_{n-1})(a0​,...,an−1​)The body bbbThe mask of a fresh ciphertext (the result of an encryption, and not the result of operations such as ciphertext addition) is a list of n uniformly random values.The body is computed as follows:b=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintextb = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintextb=(∑i=0n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintextNow that the encryption scheme is defined, let's review the example of the addition between ciphertexts to illustrate why it is slower to compute over encrypted data.To add two ciphertexts, we must add their maskmaskmask and bodybodybody:ct0=(a0,...,an−1,b)ct1=(a0′,...,an−1′,b′)ct2=ct0+ct1ct2=(a0+a0′,...,an−1+an−1′,b+b′)b+b′=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintext+(∑i=0n−1ai′∗si)+plaintext′b+b′=(∑i=0n−1(ai+ai′)∗si)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′ct_0 = (a_{0}, ..., a_{n-1}, b) \\ ct_1 = (a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b^{\prime}) \\ ct_{2} = ct_0 + ct_1 \\ ct_{2} = (a_{0} + a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1} + a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b + b^{\prime})\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintext + (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i^{\prime} * s_i}) + plaintext^{\prime}\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{(a_i + a_i^{\prime})* s_i}) + \Delta m + \Delta m^{\prime} + e + e^{\prime}\\ct0​=(a0​,...,an−1​,b)ct1​=(a0′​,...,an−1′​,b′)ct2​=ct0​+ct1​ct2​=(a0​+a0′​,...,an−1​+an−1′​,b+b′)b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintext+(i=0∑n−1​ai′​∗si​)+plaintext′b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​(ai​+ai′​)∗si​)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′To add ciphertexts, it is necessary to add both their masks and bodies. The operation involves adding n+1n + 1n+1 elements, rather than just adding two integers. This is an intuitive example to show how FHE computation is slower compared to plaintext computation. However, other operations are far more expensive (for example, the computation of a lookup table using Programmable Bootstrapping).Programmable Bootstrapping, noise management, and carry bitsIn FHE, two types of operations can be applied to ciphertexts:Leveled operations, which increase the noise in the ciphertextBootstrapped operations, which reduce the noise in the ciphertextNoise is critical in FHE because it can tamper with the message if not tracked and managed properly. Bootstrapping operations decrease noise within the ciphertexts and guarantee the correctness of computation. The rest of the operations do not need bootstrapping operations, thus they are called leveled operations and are usually very fast as a result.The following sections explain the concept of noise and padding in ciphertexts.NoiseTo ensure security, LWE requires random noise to be added to the message during encryption.TFHE scheme draws this random noise either from:A Centered Normal Distribution with a standard deviation parameter. The choice of standard deviation impacts the security level: increasing the standard deviation enhances security while keeping other factors constant.A Tweaked Uniform (TUniform) Distribution with a bound parameter 2b2^b2b defined as follows: any value in the interval (−2b,...,2b)(−2^b, ... , 2^b)(−2b,...,2b) is selected with probability 1/2b+11/2^{b+1}1/2b+1, with the two end points −2b−2^b−2b and 2b2^b2b being selected with probability 1/2b+21/2^{b+2}1/2b+2. The main advantage of this distribution is to be bounded, whereas the usual Central Normal Distribution one is not. In some practical cases, this can simplify the use of homomorphic computation. The choice of the bound impacts the security level: increasing the bound enhances security while keeping other factors constant.TFHE-rs encodes the noise in the least significant bits of each plaintext. Each leveled computation increases the value of the noise. If too many computations are performed, the noise will eventually overflow into the message bits and lead to an incorrect result.The following figure illustrates how the extra bit of noise is incurred during an addition operation.Noise overtaking the plaintexts after homomorphic addition. Most significant bits are on the left.TFHE-rs enables automatic noise management by performing bootstrapping operations to reset the noise.Programmable BootStrapping (PBS)The bootstrapping of TFHE is programmable. This allows any function to be homomorphically computed over an encrypted input, while also reducing the noise. These functions are represented by look-up tables.In general, the computation of a PBS is preceded or followed by a keyswitch, an operation to change the encryption key. The output ciphertext is then encrypted with the same key as the input one. To do this, two (public) evaluation keys are required: a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key.These operations are quite complex to describe in short, you can find more details about these operations (or about TFHE in general) in the TFHE Deep Dive.CarrySince encoded values have a fixed precision, operating on them can produce results that are outside of the original interval. To avoid losing precision or wrapping around the interval, TFHE-rs uses additional bits by defining bits of padding on the most significant bits.For example, when adding two ciphertexts, the sum could exceed the range of either ciphertext, and thus necessitate a carry that would then be transferred onto the first padding bit. In the following figure, each plaintext over 32 bits has one bit of padding on its left (the most significant bit). After the addition, the padding bit gets consumed to accommodate the carry. We refer to this process as consuming bits of padding. Without any padding-left, further additions may not produce accurate results.SecurityBy default, the cryptographic parameters provided by TFHE-rs ensure at least 128 bits of security. The security has been evaluated using the latest versions of the Lattice Estimator (repository) with red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16.For the High-Level API the default parameters are selected with a bootstrapping failure probability (or error probability) fixed at perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 for all backends (x86 CPU, GPU and HPU). A failure probability below 2−1282^{-128}2−128 ensures that our implementation is resilient against attacks in the IND-CPA-D model [1]. In the case where only the IND-CPA model is considered, there is a possibility to choose parameters with a perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64, see the dedicated Parameters section[1] Li, Baiyu, et al. "Securing approximate homomorphic encryption using differential privacy." Annual International Cryptology Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022.The parameter sets for the x86 CPU backend with a perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 are obtained using the drift mitigation technique described in [2].[2]Bernard, Olivier, et al. "Drifting Towards Better Error Probabilities in Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes".Classical public key encryption.In classical public key encryption, the public key contains a given number of ciphertexts all encrypting the value 0. By setting the number of encryptions to 0 in the public key at m=⌈(n+1)log⁡(q)⌉+λm = \lceil (n+1) \log(q) \rceil + \lambdam=⌈(n+1)log(q)⌉+λ, where nnn is the LWE dimension, qqq is the ciphertext modulus, and λ\lambdaλ is the number of security bits. This construction is secure due to the leftover hash lemma, which relates to the impossibility of breaking the underlying multiple subset sum problem. This guarantees both a high-density subset sum and an exponentially large number of possible associated random vectors per LWE sample (a,b)(a,b)(a,b).PreviousZero-knowledge proof benchmarksNextTypesLast updated 25 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

use tfhe::tfhe_hpu_backend::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// Instantiate HpuDevice --------------------------------------------------
// HPU configuration knobs are retrieved from a TOML configuration file. Prebuilt configurations could be find in `backends/tfhe-hpu-backend/config_store`
// For ease of use a setup_hpu.sh script is available in repository root folder and it handle the required environment variables setup and driver initialisation
// More details are available in `backends/tfhe-hpu-backend/README.md`
let hpu_device = HpuDevice::from_config(ShellString::new("${HPU_BACKEND_DIR}/config_store/${HPU_CONFIG}/hpu_config.toml".to_string()).expand().as_str());
// Generate keys ----------------------------------------------------------
let config = Config::from_hpu_device(&hpu_device);
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
// Register HpuDevice and key as thread-local engine
set_server_key((hpu_device, compressed_server_key));
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
// Server-side computation
let result = a + b;
// Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}Setting the hpuAn HPU device is built for a given parameter set. At this point, because HPU is still a prototype, the software provided is retrieving this parameter set from an instantiated HpuDevice. Once retrieved, reading some HPU registers, this parameter set is used by the example applications to generate both client and compressed server keys. Server key has then to be decompressed by the server to be converted into the right format and uploaded to the device. Once decompressed, the operations between CPU and HPU are identical.EncryptionOn the client-side, the method to encrypt the data is exactly the same than the CPU one, as shown in the following example: let clear_b = 128u8;

Compressing ciphertexts | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationCompressing ciphertextsThis document explains how to compress ciphertexts using the GPU. Compression can be applied on freshly encrypted ciphertexts or on ciphertexts that are the result of FHE integer operations. The syntax for ciphertext compression is identical to the one for the CPU backend, but cryptographic parameters specific to the GPU must be configured for compression.API elements discussed in this documenttfhe::shortint::parameters: this module provides the structure containing the cryptographic parameters required for the homomorphic evaluation of integer circuits as well as a list of secure cryptographic parameter sets.tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters: initializes a configuration builder with a user-specified parameter settfhe::ConfigBuilder::enable_compression: enables the compression feature in the configuration builderCryptographic parameter settingWhen using compression, the ConfigBuilder class must be initialized with the enable_compression calls. This requires that the caller sets both the cryptographic PBS parameters and the compression cryptographic parameters.The PARAM_GPU_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_4_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameter set corresponds to the default PBS parameter set instantiated by ConfigBuilder::default() when the "gpu" feature enabled.

# Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rs

Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationMulti-GPU supportThis guide explains the multi-GPU support of TFHE-rs, and walks through a practical example of performing a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions using manual GPU dispatching to improve the performance.Multi-GPU programming modelTFHE-rs supports platforms with multiple GPUs. By default, when decompressing a server key with the decompress_to_gpu function, TFHE-rs will assign all available GPUs to the server key. TFHE-rs uses all GPUs assigned to the current server key when executing operations. Depending on the type and number of available GPUs, this automatic mechanism may not achieve optimal throughput.Most integer operations have low GPU-intensity: they use few GPU cores and may not fully use the resources of a single GPU. Manual scheduling of operations on a single or on several GPUs, so that several such operations can be processed in parallel, is helpful for these types of low-GPU intensity operations.Other types of operations run optimally over several GPUs without manual scheduling but may benefit from manual scheduling on different GPUs when more than 4 GPUs are available:operations on operands of 64-bits or moremultiplication of operands of 8-bits or moreTo improve throughput by increasing GPU core utilization on all available GPUs, you can:optimize the number of GPUs assigned to a decompressed server key using the decompress_to_specific_gpu function.execute several operations in parallel on the same GPUAPI elements discussed in this documenttfhe::ServerKey::decompress_to_specific_gpu: decompresses a server key to one or multiple GPUstfhe::set_server_key: sets the current server key. When this is a GPU key, this function activates execution of integer operations on all GPUs assigned to this key. Moreover, this function will create anew CUDA stream on the current CPU thread.Multi-GPU operation scheduling exampleWhen selecting a specific GPU to execute on, there are two essential requirements that are different from a default GPU execution:You must create a GPU server key on each GPU, or subset of GPUs, individually.The batch of operations must be distributed on all the GPUs manually.Step 1: Decompress the server key to each GPUInstead of a single server key being used across all GPUs automatically, you’ll need decompress the server key to each GPU, so that the key is available in memory. For example, by default, the GPU server key is decompressed and loaded onto all available GPUs automatically as follows:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let sks = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
}However, to use the multi-GPU selection feature, you can create a vector of server keys, each on a specific GPU:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}Step 2: Define the inputs to operate onWe will be doing 100 additions in parallel on each GPU:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}At this stage, the left and right inputs reside on the CPU. They have not yet been copied to the GPU.Step3: Dispatch the workloadsNow you need to split the calculation into as many chunks as there are GPUs. TFHE-rs allows you to execute additions in parallel across multiple GPUs by leveraging CUDA streams. CUDA stream management is not explicit in the High-Level(HL) API of TFHE-rs: streams are implicitly created through calls to set_server_key in a CPU thread. As a result, when you use .par_iter() on encrypted data within the HL API, and that computation is dispatched to a GPU, it behaves as expected—executing in parallel using CUDA streams. We’ll take advantage of this behavior to maximize throughput on a multi-GPU machine. In the following example, we split a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions across multiple GPUs. Each GPU processes its own chunk of data in parallel, thanks to the creation of CUDA streams under the hood:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
left_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(
right_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
)
.enumerate()
.for_each(
|(i, (left_inputs_on_gpu_i, right_inputs_on_gpu_i))| {
left_inputs_on_gpu_i
.par_iter()
.zip(right_inputs_on_gpu_i.par_iter())
.for_each(|(left_input, right_input)| {
set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone());
let _ = left_input + right_input;
});
},
);
}In this example, par_chunks divides the input vectors into num_gpus chunks—one per GPU. Each chunk is then processed in parallel using .par_iter(). Inside the inner loop, calling set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone()) sets the context for the GPU i and implicitly creates a new CUDA stream for GPU i. This enables parallel execution on each device. It’s important to note that, in this example, when using the + operator on encrypted inputs, data is first transferred from the CPU to the GPU before computation, the result then resides on the GPU i. You can learn more about how to inspect on which GPU a piece of data resides from the examples in this file: tfhe/src/high_level_api/tests/gpu_selection.rs.Going beyond: Restrict the number of CUDA streamsWhile the behavior of .par_iter() in TFHE-rs' HL API aligns with expectations and provides parallelism over encrypted data, it can become a performance bottleneck in some cases. This is due to the way CUDA streams are managed. CUDA streams allow for parallel execution on the GPU, but when too many are created, scheduling becomes inefficient. Instead of running in parallel, operations may fall back to sequential execution. In practice, having more than 10 streams already starts to negatively impact throughput. To address this, we can limit the number of streams used per GPU. The optimal number depends on the type of operation, but the general rule is: use as few streams as possible while still fully utilizing the GPU. For example, in the case of 64-bit encrypted additions, using 4 streams per GPU offers a good balance. Each GPU processes inputs in chunks of 4 operations in parallel, repeating this in batches until all inputs are handled. Here’s how this approach looks in code:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let amounts = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
let num_streams_per_gpu = 4;
left_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(
right_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(amounts.par_chunks(chunk_size)),
)
.enumerate()
.for_each(
|(i, (left_inputs_gpu_i, (right_inputs_gpu_i, amount_gpu_i)))| {
let stream_chunk_size = left_inputs_gpu_i.len() / num_streams_per_gpu;
left_inputs_gpu_i
.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size)
.zip(right_inputs_gpu_i.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size))
.zip(amount_gpu_i.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size))
.for_each(
|((left_inputs_chunk, right_inputs_chunk), amount_chunk)| {
set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone());
left_inputs_chunk
.iter()
.zip(right_inputs_chunk.iter().zip(amount_chunk.iter()))
.for_each(|(left_input, (right_input, amount))| {
let _ = left_input + right_input;
});
},
);
},
);
}In this version, we:Define a number of streams per GPUSplit the load between the streams by calling par_chunks() on the batch assigned to each GPU.

A simple example | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationA simple exampleThe example shown in this section computes the sum of two integers using the GPU. It contains code that can be split into a client-side and a server-side part, but for simplicity it is shown as a single snippet. Only the server-side benefits from GPU acceleration.This example shows how to use a single GPU to improve operation latency. It has the following structure:Client-side: Generate client keys and GPU server keys. Encrypt two numbersServer-side: Move server keys to GPU and perform the additionClient-side: Decrypt the resultThis example only performs an addition, but most FHE operations are supported on GPU. For a list see:OperationsAPI elements discussed in this documenttfhe::ConfigBuilder::default(): Instantiates the default cryptographic parameters.

When this is a GPU key, this function activates execution of integer operations on all GPUs assigned to this key.A simple TFHE-rs program tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);

let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}When the "gpu" feature is activated, calling: let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build(); instantiates cryptographic parameters that are different from the CPU ones.Breakdown of the GPU TFHE-rs programKey generationComparing to the CPU example, in the code snippet above, the server-side must call decompress_to_gpu to enable GPU-execution for the ensuing operations on ciphertexts. This function assigns all available GPUs to the server key.Once the key is decompressed to GPU and set with set_server_key, operations on ciphertexts execute on the GPU. In the example above:compressed_server_key is a CompressedServerKey, stored on CPU. The client-side should ensure this key is generated with GPU cryptographic parameters.gpu_key is the CudaServerKey corresponding to compressed_server_key and is stored on the GPU assigned to it.set_server_key sets either a CPU or GPU key. In this example, compressed_server_key and gpu_key have GPU cryptographic parameters. A GPU server key can enable automatic parallelization on multiple GPUs.EncryptionOn the client-side, the method to encrypt the data is exactly the same as the CPU one, as shown in the following example: let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);Server-side computationThe server first needs to set up its keys with set_server_key(gpu_key). Then, homomorphic computations are performed using the same approach as the CPU operations. set_server_key(gpu_key);
let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);DecryptionFinally, the client decrypts the results using:Optimizing for throughputIn order to improve operation throughput, you can use multiple GPUs with fine-grained GPU scheduling, as detailed on the following page:https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs/blob/release/1.3.x/tfhe/docs/configuration/gpu-acceleration/multi_gpu.mdPreviousGPU accelerationNextOperationsLast updated 3 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# ZK-POKs | TFHE-rs

ZK-POKs | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationZK-POKsZero-knowledge proofs (ZK) are a powerful tool to assert that the encryption of a message is correctly formed with secure cryptographic parameters and helps thwart chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA) such as replay attacks.The CPU implementation is discussed in advanced features. During encryption, ZK proofs can be generated for a single ciphertext or for a list of ciphertexts. To use ciphertexts with proofs for computation, additional conversion steps are needed: proof expansion and proof verification. While both steps are necessary to use ciphertexts with proofs for computation, only proof expansion is sped up on GPU, while verification is performed by the CPU.ConfigurationYou can enable this feature using the flag: --features=zk-pok,gpu when building TFHE-rs.API elements discussed in this documenttfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList: a list of ciphertexts with accompanying ZK-proofs. The ciphertexts are stored in a compact form and must be expanded for computation.tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::verify_and_expand: verify the proofs for this ciphertext list and expand each ciphertext into a form that is supported for computation.Proven compact ciphertext listA proven compact list of ciphertexts can be seen as a compacted collection of ciphertexts for which encryption can be verified. This verification is currently only supported on the CPU, but the expansion can be sped up using the GPU. However, verification and expansion can be performed in parallel, efficiently using all the available computational resources.Supported typesEncrypted messages can be integers (like FheUint64) or booleans. The GPU backend does not currently support encrypted strings.ExampleThe following example shows how a client can encrypt and prove a ciphertext, and how a server can verify the proof, preprocess the ciphertext and run a computation on it on GPU:use tfhe::CompressedServerKey;

Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced Rust setupThis document provides basic instructions to configure the Rust toolchain and features for TFHE-rs.TFHE-rs requires a nightly Rust toolchain to build the C API and utilize advanced SIMD instructions. However, for other uses, a stable toolchain (version 1.81 or later) is sufficient.Follow the following instructions to install the necessary Rust toolchain:
rustup toolchain install stable
# Advanced Rust setup | TFHE-rs
rustup toolchain install nightlySetting the toolchainYou can set the toolchain using either of the following methods.Manually specify the toolchain for each cargo command:

# Contributing | TFHE-rs

Contributing | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageContributingThis document provides guidance on how to contribute to TFHE-rs.There are two ways to contribute:Report issues: Open issues on GitHub to report bugs, suggest improvements, or note typos.Submit codes: To become an official contributor, you must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Our CLA-bot will guide you through this process when you open your first pull request.1. Setting up the projectStart by forking the TFHE-rs repository.Rust version: Ensure that you use a Rust version >= 1.81 to compile TFHE-rs.Incompatibility: AArch64-based machines are not yet supported for Windows as it's currently missing an entropy source to be able to seed the CSPRNGs used in TFHE-rs.Performance: For optimal performance, it is highly recommended to run TFHE-rs code in release mode with cargo's --release flag.To get more details about the library, please refer to the documentation.2. Creating a new branchWhen creating your branch, make sure to use the following format :For example:3. Before committing3.1 LintingEach commit to TFHE-rs should conform to the standards of the project. In particular, every source code, docker or workflows files should be linted to prevent programmatic and stylistic errors.Rust source code linters: clippyTypescript/Javascript source code linters: eslint, prettierTo apply automatic code formatting, run:You can perform linting of all Cargo targets with:3.2 TestingYour contributions must include comprehensive documentation and tests without breaking existing tests. To run pre-commit checks, execute:This command ensure that all the targets in the library are building correctly.
For a faster check, use:If you're contributing to GPU code, run also:Unit testing suites are heavy and can require a lot of computing power and RAM availability.
Whilst tests are run automatically in continuous integration pipeline, you can run tests locally.All unit tests have a command formatted as:Run make help to display a list of all the commands available.To quickly test your changes locally, follow these steps:Locate where the code has changed.Add (or modify) a Cargo test filter to the corresponding make target in Makefile.Run the target.make test_<something> will print the underlying cargo command in STDOUT. You can quickly test your changes by copy/pasting the command and then modify it to suit your needs.For example, if you made changes in tfhe/src/integer/*, you can test them with the following steps:In test_integer target, replace the filter -- integer:: by -- my_new_test.Run make test_integer.4. CommittingTFHE-rs follows the conventional commit specification to maintain a consistent commit history, essential for Semantic Versioning (semver.org).
Commit messages are automatically checked in CI and will be rejected if they do not comply, so make sure that you follow the commit conventions detailed on this page.5. RebasingBefore creating a pull request, rebase your branch on the repository's main branch. Merge commits are not permitted, thus rebasing ensures fewer conflicts and a smoother PR review process.6. Opening a Pull RequestOnce your changes are ready, open a pull request.For instructions on creating a PR from a fork, refer to GitHub's official documentation.7. Continuous integrationBefore a pull request can be merged, several test suites run automatically. Below is an overview of the CI process:Useful details:pipeline is triggered by humansreview team is located in Paris timezone, pipeline launch will most likely happen during office hoursdirect changes to CI related files are not allowed for external contributorsrun make pcc to fix any build errors before pushing commits8. Data versioningData serialized with TFHE-rs must remain backward compatible. This is done using the tfhe-versionable crate.If you modify a type that derives Versionize in a backward-incompatible way, an upgrade implementation must be provided.For example, these changes are data breaking:Adding a field to a struct.Changing the order of the fields within a struct or the variants within an enum.Renaming a field of a struct or a variant of an enum.Changing the type of field in a struct or a variant in an enum.On the contrary, these changes are not data breaking:Renaming a type (unless it implements the Named trait).Adding a variant to the end of an enum.Example: adding a fieldSuppose you want to add an i32 field to a type named MyType. The original type is defined as:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
}And you want to change it to:#[versionize(MyTypeVersions)]
struct MyType {
val: u64,
other_val: i32
}Follow these steps:Navigate to the definition of the dispatch enum of this type. This is the type inside the #[versionize(MyTypeVersions)] macro attribute. In general, this type has the same name as the base type with a Versions suffix. You should find something likeenum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyType)
}Add a new variant to the enum to preserve the previous version of the type. You can simply copy and paste the previous definition of the type and add a version suffix:struct MyTypeV1 {
val: u64,
}
#[derive(VersionsDispatch)]
enum MyTypeVersions {
V0(MyTypeV0),
V1(MyTypeV1),
V2(MyType) // Here this points to your modified type
}Implement the Upgrade trait to define how we should go from the previous version to the current version: type Error = Infallible;
fn upgrade(self) -> Result<MyType, Self::Error> {
Ok(MyType {
val: self.val,
other_val: 0
})
}
}Fix the upgrade target of the previous version. In this example, impl Upgrade<MyType> for MyTypeV0 { should simply be changed to impl Upgrade<MyTypeV1> for MyTypeV0 {PreviousTFHE deep diveLast updated 5 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

What is TFHE-rs? | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageWhat is TFHE-rs?TFHE-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) to perform Boolean and integer arithmetic on encrypted data.TFHE-rs implements advanced TFHE features, empowering developers and researchers with fine-grained control over TFHE so that they can focus on high-level functionality without delving into low-level implementation.TFHE-rs includes:Rust API: the primary API for working with TFHE-rs in Rust projects.C API: for developers who prefer to use C.Client-side WASM API: to integrate TFHE-rs functionalities into WebAssembly applications.Key cryptographic conceptsTFHE is a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme based on Learning With Errors (LWE), which is a secure cryptographic primitive against even quantum computers. The TFHE-rs library implements Zama’s variant of TFHE.Homomorphic Encryption BasicsThe basic elements of cryptography:Message (or Cleartext): raw values before encryption.Plaintext: encoded messages.Ciphertext: encrypted messages.FHE allows to compute on ciphertexts without revealing the content of the messages. A scheme is fully homomorphic if it supports at least two of the following operations when evaluating any programs. (xxx is a plaintext and E[x]E[x]E[x] is the corresponding ciphertext):Homomorphic univariate function evaluation: f(E[x])=E[f(x)]f(E[x]) = E[f(x)]f(E[x])=E[f(x)]Homomorphic addition: E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]E[x] + E[y] = E[x + y]E[x]+E[y]=E[x+y]Homomorphic multiplication: E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]E[x] * E[y] = E[x * y]E[x]∗E[y]=E[x∗y]Zama's variant of TFHEZama's variant of TFHE is a fully homomorphic scheme that takes fixed-precision numbers as messages. It implements all homomorphic operations needed, such as addition and function evaluation via Programmable Bootstrapping.Refer to the preliminary whitepaper for more details.Using TFHE-rs in Rust includes the following steps:Key generation: generate a pair of keys using secure parameters.Client key: used for encryption and decryption of data. This key must be kept secret.Server key (or Evaluation key): used for performing operations on encrypted data. This key could be public.Encryption: encrypt plaintexts using the client key to produce ciphertexts.Homomorphic operation: perform operations on ciphertexts using the server key.Decryption: decrypt the resulting ciphertexts back to plaintexts using the client key.To understand more about FHE applications, see the 6-minute introduction to homomorphic encryption.PreviousWelcome to TFHE-rsNextInstallationLast updated 5 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# JS on WASM API | TFHE-rs

JS on WASM API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageJS on WASM APIThis document outlines how to use the TFHE-rs WebAssembly (WASM) client API for key generation, encryption, and decryption, providing setup examples for Node.js and web browsers.TFHE-rs supports WASM client API, which includes functionality for key generation, encryption, and decryption. However, it does not support FHE computations.TFHE-rs supports 3 WASM targets:Node.js: For use in Node.js applications or packagesWeb: For use in web browsersWeb-parallel: For use in web browsers with multi-threading supportThe core of the API remains the same, requiring only minor changes in the initialization functions.Node.jsExample: {
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfheCompactPublicKey,
TfheCompressedServerKey,
TfheConfigBuilder,
CompactCiphertextList
} = require("/path/to/built/pkg/tfhe.js");
const assert = require("node:assert").strict;
function fhe_uint32_example() {
// Makes it so that if a rust thread panics,
// the error message will be displayed in the console
init_panic_hook();
const U32_MAX = 4294967295;
const block_params = new ShortintParameters(ShortintParametersName.V1_2_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_COMPACT_PK_PBS_KS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);
let config = TfheConfigBuilder.default()
.build();
let clientKey = TfheClientKey.generate(config);
let compressedServerKey = TfheCompressedServerKey.new(clientKey);
let publicKey = TfheCompactPublicKey.new(clientKey);
let values = [0, 1, 2394, U32_MAX];
let builder = CompactCiphertextList.builder(publicKey);
for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
builder.push_u32(values[i]);
}
let compact_list = builder.build();
let serialized_list = compact_list.serialize();
let deserialized_list = CompactCiphertextList.deserialize(serialized_list);
let encrypted_list = deserialized_list.expand();
assert.deepStrictEqual(encrypted_list.len(), values.length);
for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++)
{
let decrypted = encrypted_list.get_uint32(i).decrypt(clientKey);
assert.deepStrictEqual(decrypted, values[i]);
}
}
fhe_uint32_example();
WebWhen using the Web WASM target, you should call an additional init function. With parallelism enabled, you need to call another additional initThreadPool function.Example: initThreadPool, // only available with parallelism
init_panic_hook,
ShortintParametersName,
ShortintParameters,
TfheClientKey,
TfhePublicKey,
} from "./pkg/tfhe.js";
async function example() {
await init()
await initThreadPool(navigator.hardwareConcurrency);
await init_panic_hook();
const block_params = new ShortintParameters(ShortintParametersName.V1_2_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_COMPACT_PK_PBS_KS_GAUSSIAN_2M64);
// ....
}Compiling the WASM APIUse the provided Makefile in the TFHE-rs repository to compile for the desired target:make build_node_js_api for the Node.js APImake build_web_js_api for the browser APImake build_web_js_api_parallel for the browser API with parallelismThe compiled WASM packages are located in tfhe/pkg.The browser API and the Node.js API are available as npm packages. Using npm i tfhe for the browser API and npm i node-tfhe for the Node.js API.Extra steps for web bundlersWhen using the browser API with parallelism, some extra step might be needed depending on the bundler used:Usage with WebpackIf you're using Webpack v5 (version >= 5.25.1), you don't need to do anything special, as it already supports bundling Workers out of the box.Usage with ParcelParcel v2 also recognises the used syntax and works out of the box.Usage with RollupFor Rollup, you'll need @surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread plugin (version >= 2.1.0) which brings the same functionality and was tested with this crate.Alternatively, you can use Vite which has necessary plugins built-in.(Taken from RReverser/wasm-bindgen-rayon)Using the JS on WASM APITFHE-rs uses WASM to provide a JavaScript (JS) binding to the client-side primitives, like key generation and encryption within the Boolean and shortint modules.Currently, there are several limitations. Due to a lack of threading support in WASM, key generation can be too slow to be practical for bigger parameter sets.Some parameter sets lead to the FHE keys exceeding the 2GB memory limit of WASM, making these parameter sets virtually unusable.First steps using TFHE-rs JS on WASM APISetting up TFHE-rs JS on WASM API for Node.js programs.To build the JS on WASM bindings for TFHE-rs, install wasm-pack and the necessary rust toolchain.

let params = new ShortintParameters(params_name);
// Create a new secret ClientKey, this must not be shared
console.log("Generating client keys...")
let cks = Shortint.new_client_key(params);

// Demonstrate ciphertext serialization to send over the network
let serialized_ct = Shortint.serialize_ciphertext(ct);
// Deserialize a ciphertext received over the network for example
let deserialized_ct = Shortint.deserialize_ciphertext(serialized_ct);

# Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic parity bit | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic parity bitThis tutorial shows how to build a small function that homomorphically computes a parity bit in 2 steps:Write a non-generic functionUse generics to handle the case where the function inputs are both FheBools and clear bools.The parity bit function processes two parameters:A slice of BooleanA mode (Odd or Even)This function returns a Boolean (true or false) so that the total count of true values across the input and the result matches with the specified parity mode (Odd or Even).Non-generic version
tfhe = { version = "~1.2.0", features = ["integer"] }First, define the verification function.The function initializes the parity bit to false, then applies the XOR operation across all bits, adding negation based on the requested mode.The validation function also adds the number of the bits set in the input to the computed parity bit and checks whether the sum is even or odd, depending on the mode.

}Generic versionTo enable the compute_parity_bit function to operate with both encrypted FheBool and plain bool, we introduce generics. This approach allows for validation using clear data and facilitates debugging.Writing generic functions that incorporate operator overloading for our Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) types is more complex than usual because FHE types do not implement the Copy trait. Consequently, it is necessary to use references (&) with these types, unlike native types, which typically implement Copy.This complicates generic bounds at first.Writing the correct trait boundsThe function has the following signature: fhe_bits: &[FheBool],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> boolTo make it generic, the first steps is: fhe_bits: &[BoolType],
mode: ParityMode,
) -> BoolTypeNext, define the generic bounds with the where clause.In the function, you can use the following operators:! (trait: Not)^ (trait: BitXor)Adding them to where, it gives: BoolType: Clone + Not<Output = BoolType>,
BoolType: BitXor<BoolType, Output=BoolType>,However, the compiler will return an error:error[E0369]: no implementation for `&BoolType ^ BoolType`

error: aborting due to previous errorfhe_bit is a reference to a BoolType (&BoolType), because BoolType is borrowed from the fhe_bits slice during iteration.

# Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rs

Parallelized PBS | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageParallelized PBSThis document describes the implementation and benefits of parallelized Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) in TFHE-rs, including code examples for using multi-bit PBS parameters and ensuring deterministic execution.Parallelized Programmable BootstrappingProgrammable Bootstrapping is inherently a sequential operation. However, some recent results showed that introducing parallelism is feasible at the expense of larger keys, thereby enhancing the performance of PBS. This new PBS is called a multi-bit PBS.TFHE-rs can already perform parallel execution of integer homomorphic operations. Activating this feature can lead to performance improvements, particularly in the case of high core-count CPUs when enough cores are available, or when dealing with operations that require small input message precision.The following example shows how to use parallelized bootstrapping by choosing multi-bit PBS parameters: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_2::V1_2_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(V1_2_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a >> clear_b);
Ok(())
}Deterministic parallelized Programmable BootstrappingBy nature, the parallelized PBS might not be deterministic: while the resulting ciphertext will always decrypt to the correct plaintext, the order of the operations could vary, resulting in different output ciphertext. To ensure a consistent ciphertext output regardless of execution order, add the with_deterministic_execution() suffix to the parameters.Here's an example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint32};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_2::V1_2_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

.use_custom_parameters(
V1_2_PARAM_MULTI_BIT_GROUP_3_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M64.with_deterministic_execution(),
)
.build();
let (keys, server_keys) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_keys);
let clear_a = 673u32;
let clear_b = 6u32;
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_a, &keys)?;
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(clear_b, &keys)?;
let c = &a >> &b;
let decrypted: u32 = c.decrypt(&keys);

}Beware that when the GPU feature is activated, when calling: let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();, the cryptographic parameters differ from the CPU ones, used when the GPU feature is not activated.

More precisely, if both client and server keys are still generated by the client (which is assumed to run on a CPU), the server key has then to be decompressed by the server to be converted into the right format.

# Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rs

Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationMulti-GPU supportThis guide explains the multi GPU support of TFHE-rs, and walks through a practical example of performing a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions using manual GPU
dispatching to improve the performance.Multi-GPU support overviewTFHE-rs supports platforms with multiple GPUs. There is nothing to change in the code to execute on such platforms. To keep the API as user-friendly as possible, the configuration is automatically set, i.e., the user has no fine-grained control over the number of GPUs to be used.
However, you can decide to have operations be executed on a single GPU of your choice.
In many cases this provides better throughput than using all the available GPUs to perform the operation.
Indeed, except for integer precisions above 64 bits and for the multiplication, which involves many bootstrap computations in parallel, most operations on up to 64 bits do not necessitate the full power of a GPU.
You will then be able to maximize throughput on multiple GPUs with TFHE-rs.Improving throughput on multiple-GPUsBy default, when multiple GPUs are available on the machine, TFHE-rs automatically uses them all
to perform encrypted operations. Under the hood, it includes a hard-coded logic to dispatch work across all the GPUs and to copy essential data—like the server key—to each GPU.
This approach is efficient for operations that load the GPU extensively (e.g. the 64-bit multiplication),
but not so much for smaller operations like the encrypted addition or comparison on 64-bits.
To address this, TFHE-rs also provides a mechanism to manually select which GPU to operate on.Dispatch operations on the GPUs of your choiceWhen selecting a specific GPU to execute on, there are two essential requirements that are different from a default GPU execution:You must create a GPU server key on each GPU individually.The batch of operations must be distributed on all the GPUs manually.Step 1: Decompress the server key to each GPUInstead of a single server key being used across all GPUs automatically, you’ll need specifically decompress the server key to each GPU, so that the key is available in memory.
For example, by default, the GPU server key is decompressed and loaded onto all available GPUs automatically as follows: tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let sks = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
}However, to use the multi-GPU selection feature, you can create a vector of server keys, each on a specific GPU:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}Step 2: Define the inputs to operate onWe will be doing 100 additions in parallel on each GPU:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}At this stage, the left and right inputs reside on the CPU. They have not yet been copied to the GPU.Step3: Dispatch the workloadsNow you need to split the calculation into as many chunks as there are GPUs.
TFHE-rs allows you to execute additions in parallel across multiple GPUs by leveraging CUDA streams.
CUDA stream management is not explicit in the High-Level(HL) API of TFHE-rs: streams are implicitly
created through calls to set_server_key in a CPU thread.
As a result, when you use .par_iter() on encrypted data within the HL API, and that computation is dispatched to a GPU, it behaves as expected—executing in parallel using CUDA streams.
We’ll take advantage of this behavior to maximize throughput on a multi-GPU machine. In the following example, we split a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions across multiple GPUs. Each GPU processes its own chunk of data in parallel, thanks to the creation of CUDA streams under the hood:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
left_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(
right_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
)
.enumerate()
.for_each(
|(i, (left_inputs_on_gpu_i, right_inputs_on_gpu_i))| {
left_inputs_on_gpu_i
.par_iter()
.zip(right_inputs_on_gpu_i.par_iter())
.for_each(|(left_input, right_input)| {
set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone());
let _ = left_input + right_input;
});
},
);
}In this example, par_chunks divides the input vectors into num_gpus chunks—one per GPU. Each chunk is then processed in parallel using .par_iter(). Inside the inner loop, calling set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone()) sets the context for the GPU i and implicitly creates a new CUDA stream for GPU i. This enables parallel execution on each device.
It’s important to note that, in this example, when using the + operator on encrypted inputs, data is first transferred from the CPU to the GPU before computation, the result then resides on the GPU i.
You can learn more about how to inspect on which GPU a piece of data resides from the examples in this file: tfhe/src/high_level_api/tests/gpu_selection.rs.Going beyond: Restrict the number of CUDA streamsWhile the behavior of .par_iter() in TFHE-rs' HL API aligns with expectations and provides parallelism over encrypted data, it can become a performance bottleneck in some cases. This is due to the way CUDA streams are managed.
CUDA streams allow for parallel execution on the GPU, but when too many are created, scheduling becomes inefficient. Instead of running in parallel, operations may fall back to sequential execution. In practice, having more than 10 streams already starts to negatively impact throughput.
To address this, we can limit the number of streams used per GPU. The optimal number depends on the type of operation, but the general rule is: use as few streams as possible while still fully utilizing the GPU.
For example, in the case of 64-bit encrypted additions, using 4 streams per GPU offers a good balance. Each GPU processes inputs in chunks of 4 operations in parallel, repeating this in batches until all inputs are handled.
Here’s how this approach looks in code:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let amounts = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
let num_streams_per_gpu = 4;
left_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(
right_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(amounts.par_chunks(chunk_size)),
)
.enumerate()
.for_each(
|(i, (left_inputs_gpu_i, (right_inputs_gpu_i, amount_gpu_i)))| {
let stream_chunk_size = left_inputs_gpu_i.len() / num_streams_per_gpu;
left_inputs_gpu_i
.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size)
.zip(right_inputs_gpu_i.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size))
.zip(amount_gpu_i.par_chunks(stream_chunk_size))
.for_each(
|((left_inputs_chunk, right_inputs_chunk), amount_chunk)| {
set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone());
left_inputs_chunk
.iter()
.zip(right_inputs_chunk.iter().zip(amount_chunk.iter()))
.for_each(|(left_input, (right_input, amount))| {
let _ = left_input + right_input;
});
},
);
},
);
}In this version, we:Define a number of streams per GPUSplit the load between the streams by calling par_chunks() on the batch assigned to each GPU.
This method provides a more fine-controlled form of parallelism, reaching an optimal performance on multiple GPUs with TFHE-rs.PreviousArray typesNextHPU accelerationLast updated 5 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore crypto APIQuick startThe core_crypto module from TFHE-rs is dedicated to the implementation of the cryptographic tools related to TFHE. To construct an FHE application, the shortint and/or Boolean modules (based on core_crypto) are recommended.The core_crypto module offers an API to low-level cryptographic primitives and objects, like lwe_encryption or rlwe_ciphertext. The goal is to propose an easy-to-use API for cryptographers.The overall code architecture is split in two parts: one for entity definitions and another focused on algorithms. The entities contain the definition of useful types, like LWE ciphertext or bootstrapping keys. The algorithms are then naturally defined to work using these entities.The API is convenient to add or modify existing algorithms, or to have direct access to the raw data. Even if the LWE ciphertext object is defined, along with functions giving access to the body, it is also possible to bypass these to get directly the ithi^{th}ith element of LWE mask.For instance, the code to encrypt and then decrypt a message looks like: tfhe::core_crypto::prelude::*;
// DISCLAIMER: these toy example parameters are not guaranteed to be secure or yield correct
// computations
// Define parameters for LweCiphertext creation
let lwe_dimension = LweDimension(742);
let lwe_noise_distribution =

# Boolean | TFHE-rs

Boolean | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanIn tfhe::boolean, the available operations are mainly related to their equivalent Boolean gates (i.e., AND, OR... etc). What follows are examples of a unary gate (NOT) and a binary gate (XOR). The last one is about the ternary MUX gate, which allows homomorphic computation of conditional statements of the form If..Then..Else.This library is meant to be used both on the server side and the client side. The typical use case should follow the subsequent steps:On the client side, generate the client and server keys.Send the server key to the server.Then any number of times:On the client side, encrypt the input data with the client key.Transmit the encrypted input to the server.On the server side, perform homomorphic computation with the server key.Transmit the encrypted output to the client.On the client side, decrypt the output data with the client key.SetupIn the first step, the client creates two keys, the client key and the server key, with the tfhe::boolean::gen_keys function: tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate the client key and the server key,
// using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key): (ClientKey, ServerKey) = gen_keys();
}The client_key is of type ClientKey. It is secret and must never be transmitted. This key will only be used to encrypt and decrypt data.The server_key is of type ServerKey. It is a public key and can be shared with any party. This key has to be sent to the server because it is required for homomorphic computation.Note that both the client_key and server_key implement the Serialize and Deserialize traits. This way you can use any compatible serializer to store/send the data. To store the server_key in a binary file, you can use the bincode library:use std::io::{Write, Read};
use tfhe::boolean::prelude::*;
fn main() {
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE ----------------------------
// We generate a client key and a server key, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
// We serialize the server key to bytes, and store them in a file:
let encoded: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&server_key).unwrap();
// Create a tmp dir with the current user name to avoid cluttering the /tmp dir
let user = std::env::var("USER").unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_user".to_string());
let tmp_dir_for_user = &format!("/tmp/{user}");
create_dir_all(tmp_dir_for_user).unwrap();
let server_key_file = &format!("{tmp_dir_for_user}/tutorial_server_key.bin");
// We write the server key to a file:
let mut file = File::create(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to create server key file");
file.write_all(encoded.as_slice()).expect("failed to write key to file");
// ...
// We send the key to server side
// ...
//---------------------------- SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We read the file:
let mut file = File::open(server_key_file)
.expect("failed to open server key file");
let mut encoded: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
file.read_to_end(&mut encoded).expect("failed to read key");
// We deserialize the server key:
let key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize(&encoded[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
}Encrypting inputsOnce the server key is available on the server side, it is possible to perform some homomorphic computations. The client needs to encrypt some data and send it to the server. Again, the Ciphertext type implements the Serialize and the Deserialize traits, so that any serializer and communication tool suiting your use case can be employed:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
//---------------------------- CLIENT SIDE
// We use the client key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts:
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server somehow
// ...
}Encrypting inputs using a public keyAnyone (the server or a third party) with the public key can also encrypt some (or all) of the inputs.
The public key can only be used to encrypt, not to decrypt.
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following line; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys();
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//---------------------------- SERVER or THIRD_PARTY SIDE
// We use the public key to encrypt the messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt(false);
// We serialize the ciphertexts (if not on the server already):
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
// ...
// And we send them to the server to be deserialized (if not on the server already)
// ...
}Executing a Boolean circuitOnce the encrypted inputs are on the server side, the server_key can be used to homomorphically execute the desired Boolean circuit:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
let encoded_1: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_1).unwrap();
let encoded_2: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_2).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON SERVER SIDE ----------------------------
// We deserialize the ciphertexts:
let ct_1: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_1[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
let ct_2: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_2[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// We use the server key to execute the boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);
// Then we serialize the output of the circuit:
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6)
.expect("failed to serialize output");
// ...
// And we send the output to the client
// ...
}Decrypting the outputOnce the encrypted output is on the client side, the client_key can be used to decrypt it:
fn main() {
// Don't consider the following lines; you should follow the procedure above.
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
let ct_6 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let encoded_output: Vec<u8> = bincode::serialize(&ct_6).unwrap();
//---------------------------- ON CLIENT SIDE
// We deserialize the output ciphertext:
let output: Ciphertext = bincode::deserialize(&encoded_output[..])
.expect("failed to deserialize");
// Finally, we decrypt the output:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&output);
// And check that the result is the expected one:
assert!(output);

# Integer | TFHE-rs

Integer | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegertfhe::integer is dedicated to integers smaller than 256 bits. The steps to homomorphically evaluate an integer circuit are described here.Key Typesinteger provides 3 basic key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages, thus this key is meant to be kept private and should never be shared. This key is created from parameter values that will dictate both the security and efficiency of computations. The parameters also set the maximum number of bits of message encrypted in a ciphertext.The ServerKey is the key that is used to actually do the FHE computations. It contains a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key. This key is created from a ClientKey that needs to be shared to the server, so it is not meant to be kept private. A user with a ServerKey can compute on the encrypted data sent by the owner of the associated ClientKey.To reflect this, computation/operation methods are tied to the ServerKey type.The PublicKey is a key used to encrypt messages. It can be publicly shared to allow users to encrypt data such that only the ClientKey holder will be able to decrypt. Encrypting with the PublicKey does not alter the homomorphic capabilities associated to the ServerKey.1. Key GenerationTo generate the keys, a user needs two parameters:A set of shortint cryptographic parameters.The number of ciphertexts used to encrypt an integer (we call them "shortint blocks").We are now going to build a pair of keys that can encrypt 8-bit integers (signed or unsigned) by using 4 shortint blocks that store 2 bits of message each.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}2. Encrypting valuesOnce we have our keys, we can encrypt values:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}3. Encrypting values with the public keyOnce the client key is generated, the public key can be derived and used to encrypt data.use tfhe::integer::PublicKey;
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
//We generate the public key from the secret client key:
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
//encryption
let msg1 = 128u64;
let msg2 = 13u64;
// We use the public key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg1, num_block);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt_radix(msg2, num_block);
}4. Computing and decryptingWith our server_key, and encrypted values, we can now do an addition and then decrypt the result.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 128;
let msg2 = 13;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.add_parallelized(&ct_1, &ct_2);

# Quick start | TFHE-rs

Quick start | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsQuick startThis library makes it possible to execute homomorphic operations over encrypted data, where the data are either Booleans, short integers (named shortint in the rest of this documentation), or integers up to 256 bits. It allows you to execute a circuit on an untrusted server because both circuit inputs and outputs are kept private. Data are indeed encrypted on the client side, before being sent to the server. On the server side, every computation is performed on ciphertexts.The server, however, has to know the circuit to be evaluated. At the end of the computation, the server returns the encryption of the result to the user. Then the user can decrypt it with the secret key.General method to write an homomorphic circuit programThe overall process to write an homomorphic program is the same for all types. The basic steps for using the TFHE-rs library are the following:Choose a data type (Boolean, shortint, integer)Import the libraryCreate client and server keysEncrypt data with the client keyCompute over encrypted data using the server keyDecrypt data with the client keyAPI levels.This library has different modules, with different levels of abstraction.There is the core_crypto module, which is the lowest level API with the primitive functions and types of the TFHE scheme.Above the core_crypto module, there are the Boolean, shortint, and integer modules, which contain easy to use APIs enabling evaluation of Boolean, short integer, and integer circuits.Finally, there is the high-level module built on top of the Boolean, shortint, integer modules. This module is meant to abstract cryptographic complexities: no cryptographical knowledge is required to start developing an FHE application. Another benefit of the high-level module is the drastically simplified development process compared to lower level modules.high-level APITFHE-rs exposes a high-level API by default that includes datatypes that try to match Rust's native types by having overloaded operators (+, -, ...).Here is an example of how the high-level API is used:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
let result = a + b;
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}Boolean exampleHere is an example of how the library can be used to evaluate a Boolean circuit:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys();
// We use the client secret key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(true);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(false);
// We use the server public key to execute a boolean circuit:
// if ((NOT ct_2) NAND (ct_1 AND ct_2)) then (NOT ct_2) else (ct_1 AND ct_2)
let ct_3 = server_key.not(&ct_2);
let ct_4 = server_key.and(&ct_1, &ct_2);
let ct_5 = server_key.nand(&ct_3, &ct_4);
let ct_6 = server_key.mux(&ct_5, &ct_3, &ct_4);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_6);
assert!(output);
}shortint exampleHere is a full example using shortint:Use the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
// using parameters with 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
let modulus = client_key.parameters.message_modulus().0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:

let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
// We use the server public key to execute an integer circuit:
let ct_3 = server_key.add(&ct_1, &ct_2);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output = client_key.decrypt(&ct_3);
assert_eq!(output, (msg1 + msg2) % modulus);
}integer exampleUse the --release flag to run this example (eg: cargo run --release)use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2;
fn main() {
// We generate keys to encrypt 16 bits radix-encoded integers
// using 8 blocks of 2 bits
let (cks, sks) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, 8);
let clear_a = 2382u16;
let clear_b = 29374u16;
let mut a = cks.encrypt(clear_a as u64);
let mut b = cks.encrypt(clear_b as u64);
let encrypted_max = sks.smart_max_parallelized(&mut a, &mut b);
let decrypted_max: u64 = cks.decrypt(&encrypted_max);
assert_eq!(decrypted_max as u16, clear_a.max(clear_b))

# Shortint | TFHE-rs

Shortint | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortinttfhe::shortint is dedicated to the manipulation of small unsigned integers that fit in a single LWE ciphertext. The actual size depends on the chosen parameters, but is always smaller than 8 bits. For example, with the PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameters, you can encode messages of 2 bits inside a shortint.The integer and high-level API leverage shortints to allow homomorphic computations over larger integers.The steps to homomorphically evaluate a shortint circuit are described below.Key generationtfhe::shortint provides 3 key types:ClientKeyServerKeyPublicKeyThe ClientKey is the key that encrypts and decrypts messages (small integer values). It is meant to be kept private and should never be shared. This key is created from parameter values that will dictate both the security and efficiency of computations. The parameters also set the maximum number of bits of message encrypted in a ciphertext.The ServerKey is the key that is used to evaluate the FHE computations. Most importantly, it contains a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key. This key is created from a ClientKey that needs to be shared to the server (it is not meant to be kept private). A user with a ServerKey can compute on the encrypted data sent by the owner of the associated ClientKey.Computation/operation methods are tied to the ServerKey type.The PublicKey is the key used to encrypt messages. It can be publicly shared to allow users to encrypt data such that only the ClientKey holder will be able to decrypt. Encrypting with the PublicKey does not alter the homomorphic capabilities associated to the ServerKey. tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
}Encrypting valuesOnce the keys have been generated, the client key is used to encrypt data:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Encrypting values using a public keyOnce the keys have been generated, the client key is used to encrypt data:
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, _) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let public_key = PublicKey::new(&client_key);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = public_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = public_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Computing and decryptingUsing the server_key, addition is possible over encrypted values. The resulting plaintext is recovered after the decryption via the secret client key.
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsShortintCryptographic parametersAll parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator, with an error probability equal to 2−642^{-64}2−64 when using programmable bootstrapping. This error probability is due to the randomness added at each encryption (see here for more details about the encryption process).Parameters and message precisionshortint comes with sets of parameters that permit the use of the library functionalities securely and efficiently. Each parameter set is associated to the message and carry precisions. Therefore, each key pair is entangled to precision.The user is allowed to choose which set of parameters to use when creating the pair of keys.The difference between the parameter sets is the total amount of space dedicated to the plaintext, how it is split between the message buffer and the carry buffer, and the order in which the keyswitch (KS) and bootstrap (PBS) are computed. The syntax chosen for the name of a parameter is: PARAM_MESSAGE_{number of message bits}_CARRY_{number of carry bits}_{KS_PBS | PBS_KS}. For example, the set of parameters for a message buffer of 5 bits, a carry buffer of 2 bits and where the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrap is PARAM_MESSAGE_5_CARRY_2_KS_PBS.Note that the KS_PBS order should have better performance at the expense of ciphertext size, PBS_KS is the opposite.This example contains keys that are generated to have messages encoded over 2 bits (i.e., computations are done modulus 22=42^2 = 422=4) with 2 bits of carry.The PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS parameter set is the default shortint parameter set that you can also use through the tfhe::shortint::prelude::DEFAULT_PARAMETERS constant. tfhe::shortint::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS);
let msg1 = 3;
let msg2 = 2;
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
}Impact of parameters on the operationsAs shown here, the choice of the parameter set impacts the operations available and their efficiency.Generic bi-variate functions.The computations of bi-variate functions is based on a trick: concatenating two ciphertexts into one. Where the carry buffer is not at least as large as the message buffer, this trick no longer works. In this case, many bi-variate operations, such as comparisons, cannot be correctly computed. The only exception concerns multiplication.Multiplication.In the case of multiplication, two algorithms are implemented: the first one relies on the bi-variate function trick, where the other one is based on the quarter square method. To correctly compute a multiplication, the only requirement is to have at least one bit of carry (i.e., using parameter sets PARAM_MESSAGE_X_CARRY_Y with Y>=1). This method is slower than using the other one. Using the smart version of the multiplication automatically chooses which algorithm is used depending on the chosen parameters.User-defined parameter setsIt is possible to define new parameter sets. To do so, it is sufficient to use the function new() or to manually fill the ClassicPBSParameters structure fields.For instance:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::DynamicDistribution;
fn main() {
// WARNING: might be insecure and/or incorrect
// You can create your own set of parameters
let param = ClassicPBSParameters {

# Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rs

Cryptographic parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsBooleanCryptographic parametersDefault parametersThe TFHE cryptographic scheme relies on a variant of Regev cryptosystem and is based on a problem so difficult that it is even post-quantum resistant.Some cryptographic parameters will require tuning to ensure both the correctness of the result and the security of the computation.To make it simpler, we've provided two sets of parameters, which ensure correct computations for a certain probability with the standard security of 128 bits. There exists an error probability due to the probabilistic nature of the encryption, which requires adding randomness (noise) following a Gaussian distribution. If this noise is too large, the decryption will not give a correct result. There is a trade-off between efficiency and correctness: generally, using a less efficient parameter set (in terms of computation time) leads to a smaller risk of having an error during homomorphic evaluation.In the two proposed sets of parameters, the only difference lies in this error probability. The default parameter set ensures an error probability of at most 2−642^{-64}2−64 when computing a programmable bootstrapping (i.e., any gates but the not). The other one is closer to the error probability claimed in the original TFHE paper, namely 2−1652^{-165}2−165, but it is up-to-date regarding security requirements.The following array summarizes this:DEFAULT_PARAMETERS2−642^{-64}2−64TFHE_LIB_PARAMETERS2−1652^{-165}2−165User-defined parametersYou can also create your own set of parameters.

# Operations | TFHE-rs

Operations | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerOperationsThe structure and operations related to integers are described in this section.How an integer is representedIn integer, the encrypted data is split amongst many ciphertexts encrypted with the shortint library. Below is a scheme representing an integer composed by k shortint ciphertexts.This crate implements two ways to represent an integer:the Radix representationthe CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) representationRadix-based integers.The first possibility to represent a large integer is to use a Radix-based decomposition on the plaintexts. Let B∈NB \in \mathbb{N}B∈N be a basis such that the size of BBB is smaller than (or equal to) 4 bits. Then, an integer m∈Nm \in \mathbb{N}m∈N can be written as m=m0+m1∗B+m2∗B2+...m = m_0 + m_1*B + m_2*B^2 + ...m=m0​+m1​∗B+m2​∗B2+..., where each mim_imi​ is strictly smaller than BBB. Each mim_imi​ is then independently encrypted. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.The definition of an integer requires a basis and a number of blocks. These parameters are chosen at key generation. Below, the keys are dedicated to integers encrypting messages over 8 bits, using a basis over 2 bits (i.e., B=22B=2^2B=22) and 4 blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
// We generate a set of client/server keys, using the default parameters:
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
}In this representation, the correctness of operations requires the carries to be propagated throughout the ciphertext. This operation is costly, since it relies on the computation of many programmable bootstrapping operations over shortints.CRT-based integers.The second approach to represent large integers is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this case, the basis BBB is composed of several integers bib_ibi​, such that there are pairwise coprime, and each b_ib\_ib_i has a size smaller than 4 bits. The CRT-based integer are defined modulus ∏bi\prod b_i∏bi​. For an integer mmm, its CRT decomposition is simply defined as m mod b0,m mod b1,...m \bmod{b_0}, m \bmod{b_1}, ...mmodb0​,mmodb1​,.... Each part is then encrypted as a shortint ciphertext. In the end, an Integer ciphertext is defined as a set of shortint ciphertexts.In the following example, the chosen basis is B=[2,3,5]B = [2, 3, 5]B=[2,3,5]. The integer is defined modulus 2∗3∗5=302*3*5 = 302∗3∗5=30. There is no need to pre-size the number of blocks since it is determined from the number of values composing the basis. Here, the integer is split over three blocks.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let basis = vec![2, 3, 5];
let cks = CrtClientKey::new(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, basis);
}This representation has many advantages: no carry propagation is required, cleaning the carry buffer of each ciphertext block is enough. This implies that operations can easily be parallelized. It also allows the efficient computation of PBS in the case where the function is CRT-compliant.A variant of the CRT is proposed where each block might be associated to a different key couple. Here, a keychain to the computations is required, but this may result in a performance improvement.List of available operationsThe list of operations available in integer depends on the type of representation:Negation✔️✔️Addition✔️✔️Scalar Addition✔️✔️Subtraction✔️✔️Scalar Subtraction✔️✔️Multiplication✔️✔️Scalar Multiplication✔️✔️Bitwise OR, AND, XOR✔️✔️Equality✔️✔️Left/Right Shift✔️✖️Comparisons <,<=,>, >=✔️✖️Min, Max✔️✖️Types of operationsMuch like shortint, the operations available via a ServerKey may come in different variants:operations that take their inputs as encrypted values.scalar operations take at least one non-encrypted value as input.For example, the addition has both variants:ServerKey::unchecked_add, which takes two encrypted values and adds them.ServerKey::unchecked_scalar_add, which takes an encrypted value and a clear value (the so-called scalar) and adds them.Each operation may come in different 'flavors':unchecked: always does the operation, without checking if the result may exceed the capacity of the plaintext space.checked: checks are done before computing the operation, returning an error if operation cannot be done safely.smart: always does the operation, if the operation cannot be computed safely, the smart operation will propagate the carry buffer to make the operation possible. Some of those will require a mutable reference as input: this is because the inputs' carry might be cleaned, but this will not change the underlying encrypted value.default: always compute the operation and always clear the carry. Could be slower than smart, but ensure that the timings are consistent from one call to another.Not all operations have these 4 flavors, as some of them are implemented in a way that the operation is always possible without ever exceeding the plaintext space capacity.If you don't know which flavor to use, you should use the default one.How to use each operation typeLet's try to do a circuit evaluation using the different flavors of already introduced operations. For a very small circuit, the unchecked flavor may be enough to do the computation correctly. Otherwise, checked and smart are the best options.As an example, let's do a scalar multiplication, a subtraction, and an addition.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
server_key.unchecked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.unchecked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);
server_key.unchecked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
// The carry buffer has been overflowed, the result is not correct
assert_ne!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}During this computation the carry buffer has been overflowed, and the output may be incorrect as all the operations were unchecked.If the same circuit is done but using the checked flavor, a panic will occur:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 2;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.checked_small_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar).unwrap();
server_key.checked_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_2).unwrap();
let result = server_key.checked_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &ct_3);
assert!(result.is_err());
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
// Only the scalar multiplication could be done
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar) - msg2) % modulus);
}The checked flavor permits the manual management of the overflow of the carry buffer by raising an error if correctness is not guaranteed.Using the smart flavor will output the correct result all the time. However, the computation may be slower as the carry buffer may be propagated during the computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let mut ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let mut ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);
server_key.smart_scalar_mul_assign(&mut ct_1, scalar);
server_key.smart_sub_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_2);
server_key.smart_add_assign(&mut ct_1, &mut ct_3);
// We use the client key to decrypt the output of the circuit:
let output: u64 = client_key.decrypt(&ct_1);
assert_eq!(output, ((msg1 * scalar - msg2) + msg3) % modulus);
}You must avoid cloning the inputs when calling smart operations to preserve performance. For instance, you SHOULD NOT have these kind of patterns in the code:The main advantage of the default flavor is to ensure predictable timings, as long as only this kind of operation is used. Only the parallelized version of the operations is provided.Using default could slow down computations.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
fn main() {
let num_block = 4;
let (client_key, server_key) = gen_keys_radix(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS, num_block);
let msg1 = 12u64;
let msg2 = 11u64;
let msg3 = 9u64;
let scalar = 3u64;
// message_modulus^vec_length
let modulus = client_key.parameters().message_modulus().0.pow(num_block as u32);
// We use the client key to encrypt two messages:
let mut ct_1 = client_key.encrypt(msg1);
let ct_2 = client_key.encrypt(msg2);
let ct_3 = client_key.encrypt(msg3);

server_key.sub_assign_parallelized(&mut ct_1, &ct_2);

Serialization/Deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageFine-grained APIsIntegerSerialization/DeserializationAs explained in the introduction, some types (Serverkey, Ciphertext) are meant to be shared with the server that does the computations.The easiest way to send these data to a server is to use the serialization and deserialization features. TFHE-rs uses the serde framework, so serde's Serialize and Deserialize are implemented.To be able to serialize our data, a data format needs to be picked. Here, bincode is a good choice, mainly because it is binary format.

# Debugging | TFHE-rs

Debugging | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingDebuggingThis document explains a feature to facilitate debugging.Starting from TFHE-rs 0.5, trivial ciphertexts introduce a new feature to facilitate debugging. This feature supports a debugger, print statements, and faster execution, significantly reducing waiting time and enhancing the development pace of FHE applications.Trivial ciphertexts are not secure. An application released/deployed in production must never receive trivial ciphertext from a client.To use this feature, simply call your circuits/functions with trivially encrypted values that are created using encrypt_trivial(instead of real encryptions that are created using encrypt): tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{set_server_key, generate_keys, ConfigBuilder, FheUint128};
fn mul_all(a: &FheUint128, b: &FheUint128, c: &FheUint128) -> FheUint128 {
// Use the debug format ('{:?}'), if you don't want to unwrap()
// and panic if the value is not a trivial.
println!(
"a: {:?}, b: {:?}, c: {:?}",
a.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
b.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
c.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>(),
);
let tmp = a * b;
println!("a * b = {:?}", tmp.try_decrypt_trivial::<u128>());
tmp * c
}
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default().build());
set_server_key(sks);
let a = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(1234u128);
let b = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(4567u128);
let c = FheUint128::encrypt_trivial(89101112u128);
// since all inputs are trivially encrypted, this is going to be
// much faster
let result = mul_all(&a, &b, &c);
}This example is going to print:a * b = Ok(5635678)If any input to mul_all is not a trivial ciphertexts, the computations will be done 100% in FHE, and the program will output:a * b = Err(NotTrivialCiphertextError)Using trivial encryptions as input, the example runs in 980 ms on a standard 12-core laptop, compared to 7.5 seconds on a 128-core machine using real encryptions.PreviousGeneric trait boundsNextAdvanced Rust setupLast updated 5 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# PBS statistics | TFHE-rs

PBS statistics | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingPBS statisticsThis document explains how to use the PBS statistics feature in TFHE-rs' shortint API to assess the overall computational intensity in FHE applications.The shortint API now includes a global counter to track the number of Programmable Bootstrapping (PBS) executed with the pbs-stats feature. This feature enables precise tracking of PBS executions in a circuit. It helps to estimate the overall compute intensity of FHE code using either the shortint, integer, or High-Level APIs.To know how many PBSes were executed, call get_pbs_count. To reset the PBS count, call reset_pbs_count. You can combine two functions to understand how many PBSes were executed in each part of your code.When combined with the debug mode, this feature allows for quick estimations during iterations on the FHE code.Here is an example of how to use the PBS counter: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::*;
pub fn main() {
// Config and key generation
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(config);
// Encryption
let a = FheUint32::encrypt(42u32, &cks);
let b = FheUint32::encrypt(16u32, &cks);
// Set the server key
set_server_key(sks);
// Compute and get the PBS count for the 32 bits multiplication
let c = &a * &b;
let mul_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Reset the PBS count, and get the PBS count for a 32 bits bitwise AND
reset_pbs_count();
let d = &a & &b;
let and_32_count = get_pbs_count();
// Display the result
println!("mul_32_count: {mul_32_count}");
println!("and_32_count: {and_32_count}");

# Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rs

Generic trait bounds | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageToolingGeneric trait boundsThis document serves as a practical reference for implementing generic functions in Rust that use operators across mixed references and values. The following explanations help you to understand the trait bounds necessary to handle such operations.Operators such as +, *, >>, and so on are tied to traits in std:::ops. For instance, the + operator corresponds to std::ops::Add. When writing a generic function that uses the + operator, you need to specify std::ops::Add as a trait bound.The trait bound varies slightly depending on whether the left-hand side / right-hand side is an owned value or a reference. The following table shows the different scenarios:T $op TT: $Op<T, Output=T>T $op &TT: for<'a> $Op<&'a T, Output=T>&T $op Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<T, Output=T>&T $op &Tfor<'a> &'a T: $Op<&'a T, Output=T>The for<'a> syntax refers to the Higher-Rank Trait Bounds(HRTB).Using generic functions allows for clearer input handling, which simplifies the debugging.Example std::ops::{Add, Mul};

Strings | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageTypesStringsThis document explains the FheAsciiString type for handling encrypted strings in TFHE-rs.TFHE-rs has supports for ASCII strings with the type FheAsciiString.
You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=stringsStrings are not yet compatible with CompactCiphertextList and CompressedCiphertextListSupported OperationsA variety of common operations are supported for FheAsciiString. These include:Comparisons: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, eq_ignore_caseCase conversion: to_lowercase / to_uppercaseString checks: starts_with / ends_with / containsTrimming: trim_start / trim_end / trimPrefix/suffix operations: strip_prefix / strip_suffixSearch: find / rfindWhen encrypting strings, you can add padding to hide the actual length of strings.
The null character (b'\0') is used as the padding.
Here is an example:
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.2.0", features = ["integer", "strings"] } tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, set_server_key, FheAsciiString, FheStringLen, ClearString};

// As the input string is not strictly ASCII, it is not compatible
assert!(r.is_err());
let string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt("tfhe-rs", &cks).unwrap();
// This adds 3 chars of padding to the chars of the input string
let padded_string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt_with_padding("tfhe-rs", 3, &cks).unwrap();
// This makes it so the string has 10 chars (adds padding or truncates input as necessary)
let other_string = FheAsciiString::try_encrypt_with_fixed_sized("tfhe", 10, &cks).unwrap();
let mut buffer1 = vec![];
safe_serialize(&padded_string, &mut buffer1, 1 << 30).unwrap();
let mut buffer2 = vec![];
safe_serialize(&other_string, &mut buffer2, 1 << 30).unwrap();
// The two strings created with padding, have the same
// memory/disk footprint, even though the lengths are not the same
assert_eq!(buffer1.len(), buffer2.len());
// When a string has no padding, its length is known in clear
let len = string.len();
assert!(matches!(len, FheStringLen::NoPadding(7)));
// When a string has padding, its length is only known as an encrypted value
let FheStringLen::Padding(encrypted_len) = padded_string.len() else {
panic!("Expected len to be encrypted");
};
let padded_string_len: u16 = encrypted_len.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(padded_string_len, 7); // Note padding chars are not counted

The following example shows the setup using 8-bit unsigned integers with default parameters. Additionally, ensure the integers feature is enabled, as indicated in the table on this page.The configuration is initialized by creating a builder with all types deactivated.

# Parameters | TFHE-rs

Parameters | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageCore workflowParametersThis document explains how the choice of cryptographic parameters impacts both the security and efficiency of FHE algorithms. The chosen parameters determine the error probability (sometimes referred to failure probability) and overall performance of computations using fully homomorphic encryption. This error probability is due to the noisy nature of FHE computations (see here for more details about the encryption process).All parameter sets provide at least 128-bits of security according to the Lattice-Estimator.Default parametersCurrently, the default parameters use blocks that contain 2 bits of message and 2 bits of carry - a tweaked uniform (TUniform, defined here) noise distribution, and have a bootstrapping failure probability perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128.
These are particularly suitable for applications that need to be secure in the IND-CPA^D model (see here for more details).
The GPU backend still uses an error probability smaller than 2−642^{-64}2−64 by default. Those will be updated soon.When using the high-level API of TFHE-rs, you can create a key pair using the default recommended set of parameters. For example: tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations
}These default parameters may be updated with in future releases of TFHE-rs, potentially causing incompatibilities between versions. For production systems, it is therefore recommended to specify a fixed parameter set.Parameters versioning and naming schemeParameter sets are versioned for backward compatibility. This means that each set of parameters can be tied to a specific version of TFHE-rs, so that they remain unchanged and compatible after an upgrade.All parameter sets are stored as variables inside the tfhe::shortint::parameters module, with submodules named after the versions of TFHE-rs in which these parameters where added. For example, parameters added in TFHE-rs v1.0 can be found inside tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_0.The naming convention of these parameters indicates their capabilities. Taking tfhe::parameters::v1_0::V1_0_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128 as an example:V1_0: these parameters were introduced in TFHE-rs v1.0MESSAGE_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of messageCARRY_2: LWE blocks include 2 bits of carryKS_PBS: the keyswitch is computed before the bootstrapTUNIFORM: the tweaked uniform noise distribution is used2M128: the probability of failure for the bootstrap is 2−1282^{-128}2−128For convenience, aliases are provided for the most used sets of parameters and stored in the module tfhe::shortint::parameters::aliases. Note, however, that these parameters are not stable over time and are always updated to the latest TFHE-rs version. For this reason, they should only be used for prototyping and are not suitable for production use cases.How to choose the parameter setsYou can override the default parameters with the with_custom_parameters(block_parameters) method of the Config object. For example, to use a Gaussian distribution instead of the TUniform one, you can modify your configuration as follows:use tfhe::shortint::parameters::v1_2::V1_2_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
fn main() {
let config =
ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(V1_2_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128)
.build();
// Client-side
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
// encryption and FHE operations

# Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rs

Compressing ciphertexts/keys | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingCompressing ciphertexts/keysThis document explains the mechanism and steps to compress ciphertext and keys to reduce the storage needed as well as transmission times.Most TFHE-rs entities contain random numbers generated by a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). Since the implemented PRNG is deterministic, storing only the random seed used to generate those numbers preserves all necessary information. When decompressing the entity, using the same PRNG and the same seed will reconstruct the full chain of random values.In TFHE-rs, compressible entities are prefixed with Compressed. For instance, a compressed FheUint256 is declared as CompressedFheUint256.In the following example code, we use the bincode crate dependency to serialize in a binary format and compare serialized sizes.Compressing CiphertextsCompressing ciphertexts at encryption timeThis example shows how to compress a ciphertext encrypting messages over 16 bits: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, CompressedFheUint16};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let clear = 12_837u16;
let compressed = CompressedFheUint16::try_encrypt(clear, &client_key).unwrap();
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed).unwrap().len()
);
let decompressed = compressed.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&decompressed).unwrap().len()
);
let clear_decompressed: u16 = decompressed.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear_decompressed, clear);
}Compression ciphertexts after some homomorphic computationYou can compress ciphertexts at any time, even after performing multiple homomorphic operations.To do so, you need to build a list containing all the ciphertexts that have to be compressed. This list might contain ciphertexts of different types, e.g., FheBool, FheUint32, FheInt64,...
There is no constraint regarding the size of the list.There are two possible approaches:Single list: Compressing several ciphertexts into a single list. This generally yields a better compression ratio between output and input sizes;Multiple lists: Using multiple lists. This offers more flexibility, since compression might happen at different times in the code, but could lead to larger outputs.In more details, the optimal ratio is achieved with a list whose size is
equal to the lwe_per_glwe field from the CompressionParameters.The following example shows how to compress and decompress a list containing 4 messages: one 32-bits integer, one 64-bit integer, one boolean, and one 2-bit integer.use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2, PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2,
};
use tfhe::{
set_server_key, CompressedCiphertextList, CompressedCiphertextListBuilder, FheBool,
FheInt64, FheUint16, FheUint2, FheUint32,
};
fn main() {
let config =
tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.enable_compression(COMP_PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2)
.build();
let ck = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let sk = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&ck);
set_server_key(sk);
let ct1 = FheUint32::encrypt(17_u32, &ck);
let ct2 = FheInt64::encrypt(-1i64, &ck);
let ct3 = FheBool::encrypt(false, &ck);
let ct4 = FheUint2::encrypt(3u8, &ck);
let compressed_list = CompressedCiphertextListBuilder::new()
.push(ct1)
.push(ct2)
.push(ct3)
.push(ct4)
.build()
.unwrap();
let serialized = bincode::serialize(&compressed_list).unwrap();
println!("Serialized size: {} bytes", serialized.len());
let compressed_list: CompressedCiphertextList = bincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
let a: FheUint32 = compressed_list.get(0).unwrap().unwrap();
let b: FheInt64 = compressed_list.get(1).unwrap().unwrap();
let c: FheBool = compressed_list.get(2).unwrap().unwrap();
let d: FheUint2 = compressed_list.get(3).unwrap().unwrap();
let a: u32 = a.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(a, 17);
let b: i64 = b.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(b, -1);
let c = c.decrypt(&ck);
assert!(!c);
let d: u8 = d.decrypt(&ck);
assert_eq!(d, 3);
// Out of bound index
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheBool>(4).unwrap().is_none());
// Incorrect type
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheInt64>(0).is_err());
// Correct type but wrong number of bits
assert!(compressed_list.get::<FheUint16>(0).is_err());
}Compressing keysCompressing server keysThis example shows how to compress the server keys:use tfhe::{
set_server_key, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8,
};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let cks = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_sks = CompressedServerKey::new(&cks);
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&compressed_sks).unwrap().len()
);
let sks = compressed_sks.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&sks).unwrap().len()
);
set_server_key(sks);
let clear_a = 12u8;
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(clear_a, &cks).unwrap();
let c = a + 234u8;
let decrypted: u8 = c.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(decrypted, clear_a.wrapping_add(234));
}
Compressed public keysThis example shows how to compress the classical public keys:It is not currently recommended to use the CompressedPublicKey to encrypt ciphertexts without first decompressing them. If the resulting PublicKey is too large to fit in memory, it may result in significant slowdowns.This issue has been identified and will be addressed in future releases.use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, CompressedPublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let compressed_public_key = CompressedPublicKey::new(&client_key);
println!("compressed size : {}", bincode::serialize(&compressed_public_key).unwrap().len());
let public_key = compressed_public_key.decompress();
println!("decompressed size: {}", bincode::serialize(&public_key).unwrap().len());
let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(213u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(clear, 213u8);
}Compressed compact public keyThis example shows how to use compressed compact public keys:use tfhe::{
generate_keys, CompactCiphertextList, CompressedCompactPublicKey,
ConfigBuilder, FheUint8,
};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.use_custom_parameters(
tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128,
)
.build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);
let public_key_compressed = CompressedCompactPublicKey::new(&client_key);
println!(
"compressed size : {}",
bincode::serialize(&public_key_compressed).unwrap().len()
);
let public_key = public_key_compressed.decompress();
println!(
"decompressed size: {}",
bincode::serialize(&public_key).unwrap().len()
);
let compact_list = CompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(255u8)
.build();
let expanded = compact_list.expand().unwrap();
let a: FheUint8 = expanded.get(0).unwrap().unwrap();

Data versioning | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingData versioningData versioning and backward compatibilityThis document explains how to save and load versioned data using the data versioning feature.Starting from v0.6.4, TFHE-rs supports versioned data types. This allows you to store data and load it in the future without compatibility concerns. This feature is done by the tfhe-versionable crate.This versioning scheme is compatible with all the data formats supported by serde.Saving and loading versioned dataTo use the versioning feature, wrap your types in their versioned equivalents before serialization using the versionize method.
You can load serialized data with the unversionize function, even in newer versions of TFHE-rs where the data types might evolve. The unversionize function manages any necessary data type upgrades, ensuring compatibility.

}VersionizeCalling .versionize() on a value will add versioning tags. This is done recursively so all the subtypes that compose it are versioned too. Under the hood, it converts the value into an enum where each version of a type is represented by a new variant. The returned object can be serialized using serde: bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &versioned_client_key).unwrap();UnversionizeThe Type::unversionize() function takes a versioned value, upgrades it to the latest version of its type and removes the version tags. To do that, it matches the version in the versioned enum and eventually apply a conversion function that upgrades it to the most recent version. The resulting value can then be used inside TFHE-rs let loaded_client_key =
ClientKey::unversionize(versioned_client_key).unwrap();Breaking changesWhen possible, data will be upgraded automatically without any kind of interraction. However, some changes might need information that are only known by the user of the library. These are called data breaking changes. In these occasions, TFHE-rs provides a way to upgrade these types manually.You will find below a list of breaking changes and how to upgrade them.PreviousSerialization/deserializationNextAdvanced featuresLast updated 5 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs

*Source: tfhe-rs/1.2/fhe-computation/data-handling/serialization.html*

Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageData handlingSerialization/deserializationThis document explains the serialization and deserialization features that are useful to send data to a server to perform the computations.Safe serialization/deserializationWhen dealing with sensitive types, it's important to implement safe serialization and safe deserialization functions to prevent runtime errors and enhance security. TFHE-rs provide easy to use functions for this purpose, such as safe_serialize, safe_deserialize and safe_deserialize_conformant.Here is a basic example on how to use it:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, safe_serialize};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let mut buffer = vec![];
// The last argument is the max allowed size for the serialized buffer
safe_serialize(&server_key, &mut buffer, 1 << 30).unwrap();
let _server_key_deser: ServerKey =
safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 30, &config.into()).unwrap();
}The safe deserialization must take the output of a safe-serialization as input. During the process, the following validation occurs:Type match: deserializing type A from a serialized type B raises an error indicating "On deserialization, expected type A, got type B".Version compatibility: data serialized in previous versions of TFHE-rs are automatically upgraded to the latest version using the data versioning feature.Parameter compatibility: deserializing an object of type A with one set of crypto parameters from an object of type A with another set of crypto parameters raises an error indicating "Deserialized object of type A not conformant with given parameter set"If both parameter sets have the same LWE dimension for ciphertexts, a ciphertext from param 1 may not fail this deserialization check with param 2.This check can't distinguish ciphertexts/server keys from independent client keys with the same parameters.This check is meant to prevent runtime errors in server homomorphic operations by checking that server keys and ciphertexts are compatible with the same parameter set.You can use the standalone is_conformant method to check parameter compatibility. Besides, the safe_deserialize_conformant function includes the parameter compatibility check, and the safe_deserialize function does not include the compatibility check.Size limit: both serialization and deserialization processes expect a size limit (measured in bytes) for the serialized data:On serialization, an error is raised if the serialized output exceeds the specific limit.On deserialization, an error is raised if the serialized input exceeds the specific limit.This feature aims to gracefully return an error in case of an attacker trying to cause an out-of-memory error on deserialization.Here is a more complete example:
use tfhe::conformance::ParameterSetConformant;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_serialize, safe_deserialize_conformant};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::{
PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128,
PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128};
use tfhe::conformance::ListSizeConstraint;
use tfhe::{
generate_keys, FheUint8, CompactCiphertextList, FheUint8ConformanceParams,
CompactPublicKey, ConfigBuilder, CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams
};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
let params_2 = PARAM_MESSAGE_3_CARRY_3_KS_PBS_GAUSSIAN_2M128;
assert_ne!(params_1, params_2);
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let conformance_params_1 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_1);
let conformance_params_2 = FheUint8ConformanceParams::from(params_2);
let public_key = CompactPublicKey::new(&client_key);
let msg = 27u8;
let ct = FheUint8::try_encrypt(msg, &client_key).unwrap();
assert!(ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_1));
assert!(!ct.is_conformant(&conformance_params_2));
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&ct, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
assert!(safe_deserialize_conformant::<FheUint8>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_2)
.is_err());
let ct2: FheUint8 = safe_deserialize_conformant(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params_1)
.unwrap();
let dec: u8 = ct2.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(msg, dec);
// Example with a compact list:
let msgs = [27, 188u8];
let mut builder = CompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key);
builder.extend(msgs.iter().copied());
let compact_list = builder.build();
let mut buffer = vec![];
safe_serialize(&compact_list, &mut buffer, 1 << 20).unwrap();
let conformance_params = CompactCiphertextListConformanceParams {
shortint_params: params_1.to_shortint_conformance_param(),
num_elements_constraint: ListSizeConstraint::exact_size(2),
};
safe_deserialize_conformant::<CompactCiphertextList>(buffer.as_slice(), 1 << 20, &conformance_params)
.unwrap();
}The safe serialization and deserialization use bincode internally.To selectively disable some of the features of the safe serialization, you can use SerializationConfig/DeserializationConfig builders. For example, it is possible to disable the data versioning:
use tfhe::safe_serialization::{safe_deserialize_conformant, SerializationConfig};
use tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
use tfhe::ServerKey;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, ConfigBuilder};
fn main() {
let params_1 = PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS;
let config = ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params_1).build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);

}Serialization/deserialization using serdeTFHE-rs uses the Serde framework and implements Serde's Serialize and Deserialize traits.This allows you to serialize into any data format supported by serde. However, this is a more bare bone approach as none of the checks described in the previous section will be performed for you.In the following example, we use bincode for its binary format:
[dependencies]
# Serialization/deserialization | TFHE-rs
tfhe = { version = "~1.2.0", features = ["integer"] }
bincode = "1.3.3"
use std::io::Cursor;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, ServerKey, generate_keys, set_server_key, FheUint8};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>{
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
let msg1 = 1;
let msg2 = 0;
let value_1 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg1, &client_key);
let value_2 = FheUint8::encrypt(msg2, &client_key);
// Prepare to send data to the server
// The ClientKey is _not_ sent
let mut serialized_data = Vec::new();
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &server_key)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_1)?;
bincode::serialize_into(&mut serialized_data, &value_2)?;
// Simulate sending serialized data to a server and getting
// back the serialized result
let serialized_result = server_function(&serialized_data)?;
let result: FheUint8 = bincode::deserialize(&serialized_result)?;
let output: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(output, msg1 + msg2);
Ok(())
}
fn server_function(serialized_data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut serialized_data = Cursor::new(serialized_data);
let server_key: ServerKey = bincode::deserialize_from(&mut serialized_data)?;

# Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rs

Encrypted pseudo random values | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresEncrypted pseudo random valuesThis document explains the mechanism and steps to generate an oblivious encrypted random value using only server keys.The goal is to give to the server the possibility to generate a random value, which will be obtained in an encrypted format and will remain unknown to the server. The implementation is based on this article.This is possible through two methods on FheUint and FheInt:generate_oblivious_pseudo_random which return an integer taken uniformly in the full integer range ([0; 2^N[ for a FheUintN and [-2^(N-1); 2^(N-1)[ for a FheIntN).generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded which return an integer taken uniformly in [0; 2^random_bits_count[. For a FheUintN, we must have random_bits_count <= N. For a FheIntN, we must have random_bits_count <= N - 1.Both methods functions take a seed Seed as input, which could be any u128 value.
They both rely on the use of the usual server key.
The output is reproducible, i.e., the function is deterministic from the inputs: assuming the same hardware, seed and server key, this function outputs the same random encrypted value.Here is an example of the usage: tfhe::prelude::FheDecrypt;
use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8, FheInt8, Seed};
pub fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let random_bits_count = 3;
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheUint8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: u8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
assert!(dec_result < (1 << random_bits_count));
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random(Seed(0));
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);
let ct_res = FheInt8::generate_oblivious_pseudo_random_bounded(Seed(0), random_bits_count);
let dec_result: i8 = ct_res.decrypt(&client_key);

# Overflow detection | TFHE-rs

Overflow detection | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresOverflow detectionThis document explains how TFHE-rs implements specific operations to detect overflows in computations.The mechanism of detecting overflow consists in returning an encrypted flag with a specific ciphertext that reflects the state of the computation. When an overflow occurs, this flag is set to true. Since the server is not able to evaluate this encrypted value, the client has to check the flag value when decrypting to determine if an overflow has happened.These operations might be slower than their non-overflow-detecting equivalent, so they are not enabled by default. To use them, you must explicitly call specific operators. At the moment, only additions, subtractions, and multiplications are supported. We plan to add more operations in future releases.Here's the list of operations supported along with their symbol:Addoverflow_addBinarySuboverflow_subBinaryMuloverflow_mulBinaryThe usage of these operations is similar to the standard ones. The key difference is in the decryption process, as shown in following example:
//
// * The operation is modular, i.e on overflow the result wraps around.
// * On overflow the [FheBool] is true, otherwise false

# Public key encryption | TFHE-rs

Public key encryption | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresPublic key encryptionThis document explains public key encryption and provides instructions for 2 methods.Public key encryption refers to the cryptographic paradigm where the encryption key can be publicly distributed, whereas the decryption key remains secret to the owner. This differs from the usual case where the same secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. In TFHE-rs, there are two methods for public key encryptions:Classical public key: the first method involves the public key containing many encryptions of zero, as detailed in Guide to Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the [Discretized] Torus, Appendix A.Compact public key: the second method is based on the paper TFHE Public-Key Encryption Revisited, allowing for significantly smaller key sizes compared to the first method.Public keys can also be compressed to reduce size.Classical public keyThis example shows how to use classical public keys. tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, FheUint8, PublicKey};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, _) = generate_keys(config);

let a = FheUint8::try_encrypt(255u8, &public_key).unwrap();
let clear: u8 = a.decrypt(&client_key);

}Compact public keyThis example shows how to use compact public keys. The main difference is in the ConfigBuilder where the parameter set has been changed.For more information on using compact public keys to encrypt data and generate a zero-knowledge proof of correct encryption at the same time, see the guide on ZK proofs.use tfhe::{

# Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rs

Multi-threading with Rayon crate | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresMulti-threading with Rayon crateThis document describes how to use Rayon for parallel processing in TFHE-rs, detailing configurations for single and multi-client applications with code examples.Rayon is a popular Rust crate that simplifies writing multi-threaded code. You can use Rayon to write multi-threaded TFHE-rs code. However, due to the specifications of Rayon and TFHE-rs, certain setups are necessary.Single-client applicationThe problemThe high-level API requires to call set_server_key on each thread where computations need to be done. So a first attempt to use Rayon with TFHE-rs might look like this: tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
// set_server_key in each closure as they might be
// running in different threads
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
set_server_key(sks.clone());
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
}However, due to Rayon's work-stealing mechanism and TFHE-rs' internals, this may create BorrowMutError.Working exampleThe correct way is to call rayon::broadcast as follows:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks, sks) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
// set the server key in all of the rayon's threads so that
// we won't need to do it later
rayon::broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks.clone()));
// Set the server key in the main thread
set_server_key(sks);
let xs = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks),
];
let ys = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks),
];
let (a, b) = rayon::join(
|| {
&xs[0] + &ys[0]
},
|| {
&xs[1] + &ys[1]
}
);
let a: u8 = a.decrypt(&cks);
let b: u8 = b.decrypt(&cks);
assert_eq!(a, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b, 6u8);
}Multi-client applicationsFor applications that need to operate concurrently on data from different clients and require each client to use multiple threads, you need to create separate Rayon thread pools:use tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, generate_keys};
fn main() {
let (cks1, sks1) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(1u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(2u8, &cks1),
];
let ys1 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(3u8, &cks1),
FheUint8::encrypt(4u8, &cks1),
];
let (cks2, sks2) = generate_keys(ConfigBuilder::default());
let xs2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(100u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(200u8, &cks2),
];
let ys2 = [
FheUint8::encrypt(103u8, &cks2),
FheUint8::encrypt(204u8, &cks2),
];
let client_1_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
let client_2_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(2).build().unwrap();
client_1_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));
client_2_pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks2.clone()));
let ((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) = rayon::join(|| {
client_1_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs1[0] + &ys1[0]
},
|| {
&xs1[1] + &ys1[1]
}
)
})
}, || {
client_2_pool.install(|| {
rayon::join(
|| {
&xs2[0] + &ys2[0]
},
|| {
&xs2[1] + &ys2[1]
}
)
})
});
let a1: u8 = a1.decrypt(&cks1);
let b1: u8 = b1.decrypt(&cks1);
assert_eq!(a1, 4u8);
assert_eq!(b1, 6u8);
let a2: u8 = a2.decrypt(&cks2);
let b2: u8 = b2.decrypt(&cks2);
assert_eq!(a2, 203u8);
assert_eq!(b2, 148u8);
}This can be useful if you have some rust #[test], see the example below:#[test]
fn test_1() {
let pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4).build().unwrap();
pool.broadcast(|_| set_server_key(sks1.clone()));
pool.install(|| {
let result = call_to_a_multithreaded_function(...);
assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
})
}

For example, when computing the sum of a list of ciphertexts, you typically initialize the sum variable to 0.Instead of asking the client to send an actual encrypted zero, the server can use a trivial encryption. A trivial encryption creates a ciphertext that contains the desired value but isn't securely encrypted - essentially anyone, any key can decrypt it. tfhe::prelude::*;

# Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rs

Zero-knowledge proofs | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageAdvanced featuresZero-knowledge proofsThis document explains how to implement the zero-knowledge proofs function for compact public key encryption to verify the encryption process without revealing the encrypted information.TFHE-rs can generate zero-knowledge proofs to verify that the compact public key encryption process is correct. In other words, TFHE-rs generates the proof without revealing any information other than the already known range of the encrypted message. This technique is derived from Libert’s work.You can enable this feature using the flag: --features=zk-pok when building TFHE-rs.To use this feature, you must first generate a CRS (Common Reference String). The CRS is a piece of cryptographic data that is necessary to ensure the security of zero-knowledge proofs. The CRS should be generated in advance and shared between all the clients and the server. A CRS can be reused for multiple encryptions with the same parameters.Once the CRS is generated, using zero-knowledge proofs is straightforward: during encryption, the client generates the proof, and the server validates it before performing any homomorphic computations.Note that you need to use dedicated parameters for the compact public key encryption. This helps to reduce the size of encrypted data and speed up the zero-knowledge proof computation.The following example shows how a client can encrypt and prove a ciphertext, and how a server can verify and compute the ciphertext: rand::prelude::*;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};
pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Indicate which parameters to use for the Compact Public Key encryption
let cpk_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_PKE_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// And parameters allowing to keyswitch/cast to the computation parameters.
let casting_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_KEYSWITCH_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Enable the dedicated parameters on the config
let config = tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params)
.use_dedicated_compact_public_key_parameters((cpk_params, casting_params)).build();
// The CRS should be generated in an offline phase then shared to all clients and the server
let crs = CompactPkeCrs::from_config(config, 64).unwrap();
// Then use TFHE-rs as usual
let client_key = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let server_key = tfhe::ServerKey::new(&client_key);
let public_key = tfhe::CompactPublicKey::try_new(&client_key).unwrap();
// This can be left empty, but if provided allows to tie the proof to arbitrary data
let metadata = [b'T', b'F', b'H', b'E', b'-', b'r', b's'];
let clear_a = rng.gen::<u64>();
let clear_b = rng.gen::<u64>();
let proven_compact_list = tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(clear_a)
.push(clear_b)
.build_with_proof_packed(&crs, &metadata, ZkComputeLoad::Verify)?;
// Server side
let result = {
set_server_key(server_key);
// Verify the ciphertexts
let expander =
proven_compact_list.verify_and_expand(&crs, &public_key, &metadata)?;
let a: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(0)?.unwrap();
let b: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(1)?.unwrap();
a + b
};
// Back on the client side
let a_plus_b: u64 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
assert_eq!(a_plus_b, clear_a.wrapping_add(clear_b));
Ok(())
}Performance can be improved by setting lto="fat" in Cargo.tomllto = "fat"and by building the code for the native CPU architecture and in release mode, e.g. by calling RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release.You can choose a more costly proof with ZkComputeLoad::Proof, which has a faster verification time. Alternatively, you can select ZkComputeLoad::Verify for a faster proof and slower verification.Scheme versionThe ZK scheme used to generate and verify proofs is available in two versions:ZKV1: This version is close to the original paper from Libert.ZKV2: Differing from the paper, this version provides better performance for provers and verifiers.TFHE-rs selects automatically the scheme to use based on the encryption parameters during the CRS generation. With default parameters, ZKV2 is selected.The following example shows how to generate a CRS and proofs for ZKV1. Compared to the previous example, only the parameters are changed:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;

# Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringThis tutorial demonstrates how to build your own data type that represents an ASCII string in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) by implementing to_lower and to_upper functions.Since version 0.11, TFHE-rs has introduced the strings feature, which provides an easy to use FHE strings API. See the fhe strings guide for more information.An ASCII character is stored in 7 bits. In this tutorial, we use the FheUint8 to store an encrypted ASCII:The uppercase letters are in the range [65, 90]The lowercase letters are in the range [97, 122]The relationship between uppercase and lowercase letters is defined as follows:lower_case = upper_case + UP_LOW_DISTANCEupper_case = lower_case - UP_LOW_DISTANCEWhere UP_LOW_DISTANCE = 32Types and methodsThis type stores the encrypted characters as a Vec<FheUint8> to implement case conversion functions.To use the FheUint8 type, enable the integer feature:
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.2.0", features = ["integer"] }The MyFheString::encrypt function performs data validation to ensure the input string contains only ASCII characters.In FHE operations, direct branching on encrypted values is not possible. However, you can evaluate a boolean condition to obtain the desired outcome. Here is an example to check and convert the 'char' to a lowercase without using a branch:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
if c > 64 && c < 91 {
c + UP_LOW_DISTANCE
} else {
c
}
}You can remove the branch this way:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
c + ((c > 64) as u8 & (c < 91) as u8) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}This method can adapt to operations on homomorphic integers:
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::FheUint8;
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}Full example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ClientKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8};

tfhe = { version = "~1.2.0", features = ["strings"] }The FheAsciiString type allows to simply do homomorphic case changing of encrypted strings (and much more!):use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheAsciiString};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string =

# SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rs

SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSHA256 with Boolean APIThis tutorial guides you to convert a regular SHA-256 function to its homomorphic version, with considerations of optimal performances. You will learn:The basics of the SHA-256 function.The steps to implement SHA-256 homomorphically.SHA-256 basicsFirst, you need to implement the SHA-256 function. You can find the official specification for SHA-256 here. We summarize the three key aspects of SHA-256 outlined in the document:PaddingThe SHA-256 function processes the input data in blocks or chunks of 512 bits. Before performing the hash computations, prepare the data as follows:Append a single "1" bitAppend "0" bits until exactly 64 bits remain to make the message length a multiple of 512Append the last 64 bits as a binary encoding of the original input lengthIn this diagram, the numbers on the top represent the length of the padded input at each position. The formula L+1+k+64 ensures that the length reaches a multiple of 512, matching the required length of the padded input.Operations and functionsWe will use bitwise AND, XOR, NOT, addition modulo 2^32, the Rotate Right (ROTR) and Shift Right (SHR) operations as building blocks for functions inside the SHA-256 computation. These operations all use 32-bit words and produce new words.We combine these operations inside the sigma (with 4 variations), Ch, and Maj functions. When changing SHA-256 to the homomorphic computation, we will mainly change the code of each operation.Here is the definition of each function:Maj(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) XOR (y AND z)
Σ0(x) = ROTR-2(x) XOR ROTR-13(x) XOR ROTR-22(x)
Σ1(x) = ROTR-6(x) XOR ROTR-11(x) XOR ROTR-25(x)
σ0(x) = ROTR-7(x) XOR ROTR-18(x) XOR SHR-3(x)
σ1(x) = ROTR-17(x) XOR ROTR-19(x) XOR SHR-10(x)We simplify Maj using the Boolean distributive law: (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) = x AND (y XOR z), as shown below:We simplify Ch using a single bitwise multiplexer. Here's the truth table of the Ch expression.00000011010001111000101011011111This table shows that the result equals to z when x = 0, and the result equals to y when x = 1, which means if x {y} else {z}. Hence we can replace the 4 bitwise operations of Ch by a single bitwise multiplexer.All these operations can be evaluated homomorphically:ROTR and SHR: They can be evaluated by changing the index of each ecrypted bit of the word without using any homomorphic operation.Bitwise AND, XOR and multiplexer: They can be computed homomorphicallyAddition modulo 2^32: It can be broken down into boolean homomorphic operations.SHA-256 computationThe SHA-256 function processes data in 512-bit chunks. Here is what happens during computation:The 512-bit chunk is computed into 16 words, each containing 32 bits.Another 48 words are computed using the previous function.After computing the 64 words, within the same chunk, a compression loop will compute a hash value (8 32-bit words) using the previous functions and some constants to mix everything up.This entire process iterate through each 512-bit chunk of your data.When we finish the last chunk iteration, the resulting hash values will be the output of the SHA-256 function.Here is an example of this function using arrays of 32 bools to represent words:
// Initialize hash values with constant values
let mut hash: [[bool; 32]; 8] = [
hex_to_bools(0x6a09e667), hex_to_bools(0xbb67ae85),
hex_to_bools(0x3c6ef372), hex_to_bools(0xa54ff53a),
hex_to_bools(0x510e527f), hex_to_bools(0x9b05688c),
hex_to_bools(0x1f83d9ab), hex_to_bools(0x5be0cd19),
];
let chunks = padded_input.chunks(512);
for chunk in chunks {
let mut w = [[false; 32]; 64];
// Copy first 16 words from current chunk
for i in 0..16 {
w[i].copy_from_slice(&chunk[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32]);
}
// Compute the other 48 words
for i in 16..64 {
w[i] = add(add(add(sigma1(&w[i - 2]), w[i - 7]), sigma0(&w[i - 15])), w[i - 16]);
}
let mut a = hash[0];
let mut b = hash[1];
let mut c = hash[2];
let mut d = hash[3];
let mut e = hash[4];
let mut f = hash[5];
let mut g = hash[6];
let mut h = hash[7];
// Compression loop, each iteration uses a specific constant from K
for i in 0..64 {
let temp1 = add(add(add(add(h, ch(&e, &f, &g)), w[i]), hex_to_bools(K[i])), sigma_upper_case_1(&e));
let temp2 = add(sigma_upper_case_0(&a), maj(&a, &b, &c));
h = g;
g = f;
f = e;
e = add(d, temp1);
d = c;
c = b;
b = a;
a = add(temp1, temp2);
}
hash[0] = add(hash[0], a);
hash[1] = add(hash[1], b);
hash[2] = add(hash[2], c);
hash[3] = add(hash[3], d);
hash[4] = add(hash[4], e);
hash[5] = add(hash[5], f);
hash[6] = add(hash[6], g);
hash[7] = add(hash[7], h);
}
// Concatenate the final hash values to produce a 256-bit hash
let mut output = [false; 256];
for i in 0..8 {
output[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32].copy_from_slice(&hash[i]);
}
output
}Homomorphic SHA-256 on encrypted dataTo convert SHA-256 to a homomorphic version, you can replace each bit of padded_input with a fully homomorphic encryption of the same bit value and operate on the encrypted value using homomorphic operations.While the structure of the SHA-256 function remains the same, there are some important considerations in the code:The function signature and the borrowing rules should adapt to the ciphertext type (representing the encrypted bits).Implementing SHA-256 operations with homomorphic encryption uses homomorphic boolean operations internally.Homomorphic operations on encrypted data can be very expensive. Consider these options for better speed:Remove unnecessary use of homomorphic operations and maximize parallelization.Simplify the code with Rayon crate that parallelizes iterators and manages threads efficiently.The final code is available here.Now let's dive into details of each SHA256 operation.Rotate Right and Shift RightRotate Right and Shift Right can be evaluated by changing the position of each encrypted bit in the word, requiring no homomorphic operations. Here is the implementation: let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result
}
fn shift_right(x: &[Ciphertext; 32], n: usize, sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result[..n].fill_with(|| sk.trivial_encrypt(false));
result
}Bitwise XOR, AND, MultiplexerTo implement these operations, we will use the xor, and mux methods from the TFHE-rs library to perform each boolean operation homomorphically.For better efficiency, we can parallelize the homomorphic computations because we operate bitwise. It means that we can homomorphically XOR the bits at index 0 of two words using one thread while XORing the bits at index 1 using another thread, and so on. This approach allows for the computation of bitwise operations using up to 32 concurrent threads, corresponding to the 32-bit words used.Here is the implementation of the bitwise homomorphic XOR operation. The par_iter and par_iter_mut methods create a parallel iterator that we use to compute each XOR efficiently. The other two bitwise operations are implemented in the same way. let mut result = a.clone();
result.par_iter_mut()
.zip(a.par_iter().zip(b.par_iter()))
.for_each(|(dst, (lhs, rhs))| *dst = sk.xor(lhs, rhs));
result
}Addition modulo 2^32This might be the trickiest operation to efficiently implement in a homomorphic manner. A naive implementation could use the Ripple Carry Adder algorithm, which is straightforward but cannot be parallelized because each step depends on the previous one.A better choice is to use Carry Lookahead Adder, which allows us to use the parallelized AND and XOR bitwise operations. With this design, our adder is around 50% faster than the Ripple Carry Adder. let propagate = xor(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
let generate = and(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise AND
let carry = compute_carry(&propagate, &generate, sk);
let sum = xor(&propagate, &carry, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
sum
}
fn compute_carry(propagate: &[Ciphertext; 32], generate: &[Ciphertext; 32], sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut carry = trivial_bools(&[false; 32], sk);
carry[31] = sk.trivial_encrypt(false);
for i in (0..31).rev() {
carry[i] = sk.or(&generate[i + 1], &sk.and(&propagate[i + 1], &carry[i + 1]));
}
carry
}To further optimize performance, we use parallel prefix algorithms to parallelize the function that computes the carry signals. These algorithms involve more (homomorphic) boolean operations and their parallel nature speeds up the processing. We have implemented the Brent-Kung and Ladner-Fischer algorithms with different tradeoffs:Brent-Kung has the least amount of boolean operations we could find (140 when using grey cells, for 32-bit numbers), which makes it suitable when we can't process many operations concurrently and fast. Our results confirm that it's indeed faster than both the sequential algorithm and Ladner-Fischer when run on regular computers.On the other hand, Ladner-Fischer performs more boolean operations (209 using grey cells) than Brent-Kung, but they are performed in larger batches. Hence we can compute more operations in parallel and finish earlier, but we need more fast threads available or they will slow down the carry signals computation. Ladner-Fischer can be suitable when using cloud-based computing services, which offer many high-speed threads.Our implementation uses Brent-Kung by default, but you can enable Ladner-Fischer by using the --ladner-fischer command line argument.For more information about parallel prefix adders, you can read this paper or this other paper.Finally, with all these SHA-256 operations working homomorphically, our functions will be homomomorphic as well along with the whole SHA-256 function (after adapting the code to work with the Ciphertext type).More parallel processingLet's talk about other performance improvements we can make before we finish.In the main sha256_fhe, you can perform some functions in parallel. For example, in the compression loop, temp1 and temp2 can be computed in parallel by using the rayon::join() function when there is a CPU available. The two temporary values in the compression loop are the result of multiple additions, so you can use nested calls to rayon::join() to parallelize more operations.Another way to speed up consecutive additions would be using the Carry Save Adder, a very efficient adder that takes 3 numbers and returns a sum and a carry sequence. If our inputs are A, B, and C, we can construct a CSA with our previously implemented Maj function and the bitwise XOR operation as follows:Sum = A XOR B XOR CBy chaining CSAs, we can input the sum and carry from a preceding stage along with another number into a new CSA. Finally, to get the result of the additions we add the sum and carry sequences using a conventional adder. In the end, we are performing the same number of additions, but some of them are now CSAs, speeding up the process. Below is the illustration of this process in the temp1 and temp2 computations. || {
let ((sum, carry), s1) = rayon::join(
|| {
let ((sum, carry), ch) = rayon::join(
|| csa(&h, &w[i], &trivial_bools(&hex_to_bools(K[i]), sk), sk),
|| ch(&e, &f, &g, sk),
);
csa(&sum, &carry, &ch, sk)
},
|| sigma_upper_case_1(&e, sk)
);
let (sum, carry) = csa(&sum, &carry, &s1, sk);
add(&sum, &carry, sk)
},
|| {
add(&sigma_upper_case_0(&a, sk), &maj(&a, &b, &c, sk), sk)
},
);The first closure of the outer call to join will return temp1 and the second temp2.Inside the first outer closure, we call join recursively until we add the value h, the current word w[i], and the current constant K[i] by using the CSA, while potentially computing the ch function in parallel. Then we take the sum, carry, and ch values and add them again using the CSA.All this is done while potentially computing the sigma_upper_case_1 function. Finally we input the previous sum, carry, and sigma values to the CSA and perform the final addition with add. Once again, this is done while potentially computing sigma_upper_case_0 and maj and adding them to get temp2, in the second outer closure.With these types of changes, we finally get a homomorphic SHA256 function that doesn't leave unused computational resources.How to use SHA256_boolFirst, use the --release flag when running the program. Considering the implementation of encrypt_bools and decrypt_bools, the use of SHA-256 will be as follows: let matches = Command::new("Homomorphic sha256")
.arg(Arg::new("ladner_fischer")
.long("ladner-fischer")
.help("Use the Ladner Fischer parallel prefix algorithm for additions")
.action(ArgAction::SetTrue))
.get_matches();
// If set using the command line flag "--ladner-fischer" this algorithm will be used in additions
let ladner_fischer: bool = matches.get_flag("ladner_fischer");
// INTRODUCE INPUT FROM STDIN
let mut input = String::new();
println!("Write input to hash:");
io::stdin()
.read_line(&mut input)
.expect("Failed to read line");
input = input.trim_end_matches('\n').to_string();
println!("You entered: \"{}\"", input);
// CLIENT PADS DATA AND ENCRYPTS IT
let (ck, sk) = gen_keys();
let padded_input = pad_sha256_input(&input);
let encrypted_input = encrypt_bools(&padded_input, &ck);
// SERVER COMPUTES OVER THE ENCRYPTED PADDED DATA
println!("Computing the hash");
let encrypted_output = sha256_fhe(encrypted_input, ladner_fischer, &sk);
// CLIENT DECRYPTS THE OUTPUT
let output = decrypt_bools(&encrypted_output, &ck);
let outhex = bools_to_hex(output);
println!("{}", outhex);
}We can supply the data to hash using a file instead of the command line by using stdin . For example, if the file input.txt is in the same directory as the project, we can use the following shell command after building with cargo build --release:The program accepts hexadecimal inputs. The input must start with "0x" and contain only valid hex digits, otherwise it will be interpreted as text.Finally， padding is performed on the client side. This has the advantage of hiding the exact length of the input content from the server, thus avoiding the server extracting information from the length, even though the content is fully encrypted.It is also feasible to perform padding on the server side. The padding function would take the encrypted input and pad it with trivial bit encryptions. We can then integrate the padding function into the sha256_fhe function computed by the server.PreviousHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringNextAll tutorialsLast updated 5 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Security and cryptography | TFHE-rs

Security and cryptography | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSecurity and cryptographyThis document introduces the cryptographic concepts of the scheme of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) and the security considerations of TFHE-rs.TFHETFHE-rs is a cryptographic library that implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the TFHE scheme. You should understand the basics of TFHE to consider its limitations, such as:The precision: TFHE has limitations on the number of bits used to represent plaintext values.The execution time: TFHE operations are slower than native operations due to their complexity.LWE ciphertextsTFHE-rs primarily utilizes Learning With Errors (LWE) ciphertexts. The LWE problem forms the basis of TFHE's security and is considered resistant to quantum attacks.An LWE Ciphertext is a collection of 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integers. Before encrypting a message in an LWE ciphertext, you first need to encode it as a plaintext by shifting the message to the most significant bits of the unsigned integer type used.Then, you add a small random value called noise to the least significant bits. This noise is crucial in ensuring the security of the ciphertext.plaintext=(Δ∗m)+eplaintext = (\Delta * m) + eplaintext=(Δ∗m)+em∈Zpm \in \mathbb{Z}_pm∈Zp​To get a ciphertext from a plaintext, you must encrypt the plaintext using a secret key.An LWE secret key is a list of n random integers: S=(s0,...,sn−1)S = (s_0, ..., s_{n-1})S=(s0​,...,sn−1​). nnn is called the LweDimensionLweDimensionLweDimensionAn LWE ciphertext is composed of two parts:The mask (a0,...,an−1)(a_0, ..., a_{n-1})(a0​,...,an−1​)The body bbbThe mask of a fresh ciphertext (the result of an encryption, and not the result of operations such as ciphertext addition) is a list of n uniformly random values.The body is computed as follows:b=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintextb = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintextb=(∑i=0n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintextNow that the encryption scheme is defined, let's review the example of the addition between ciphertexts to illustrate why it is slower to compute over encrypted data.To add two ciphertexts, we must add their maskmaskmask and bodybodybody:ct0=(a0,...,an−1,b)ct1=(a0′,...,an−1′,b′)ct2=ct0+ct1ct2=(a0+a0′,...,an−1+an−1′,b+b′)b+b′=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintext+(∑i=0n−1ai′∗si)+plaintext′b+b′=(∑i=0n−1(ai+ai′)∗si)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′ct_0 = (a_{0}, ..., a_{n-1}, b) \\ ct_1 = (a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b^{\prime}) \\ ct_{2} = ct_0 + ct_1 \\ ct_{2} = (a_{0} + a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1} + a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b + b^{\prime})\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintext + (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i^{\prime} * s_i}) + plaintext^{\prime}\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{(a_i + a_i^{\prime})* s_i}) + \Delta m + \Delta m^{\prime} + e + e^{\prime}\\ct0​=(a0​,...,an−1​,b)ct1​=(a0′​,...,an−1′​,b′)ct2​=ct0​+ct1​ct2​=(a0​+a0′​,...,an−1​+an−1′​,b+b′)b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintext+(i=0∑n−1​ai′​∗si​)+plaintext′b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​(ai​+ai′​)∗si​)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′To add ciphertexts, it is necessary to add both their masks and bodies. The operation involves adding n+1n + 1n+1 elements, rather than just adding two integers. This is an intuitive example to show how FHE computation is slower compared to plaintext computation. However, other operations are far more expensive (for example, the computation of a lookup table using Programmable Bootstrapping).Programmable Bootstrapping, noise management, and carry bitsIn FHE, two types of operations can be applied to ciphertexts:Leveled operations, which increase the noise in the ciphertextBootstrapped operations, which reduce the noise in the ciphertextNoise is critical in FHE because it can tamper with the message if not tracked and managed properly. Bootstrapping operations decrease noise within the ciphertexts and guarantee the correctness of computation. The rest of the operations do not need bootstrapping operations, thus they are called leveled operations and are usually very fast as a result.The following sections explain the concept of noise and padding in ciphertexts.NoiseTo ensure security, LWE requires random noise to be added to the message during encryption.TFHE scheme draws this random noise either from:A Centered Normal Distribution with a standard deviation parameter. The choice of standard deviation impacts the security level: increasing the standard deviation enhances security while keeping other factors constant.A Tweaked Uniform (TUniform) Distribution with a bound parameter 2b2^b2b defined as follows: any value in the interval (−2b,...,2b)(−2^b, ... , 2^b)(−2b,...,2b) is selected with probability 1/2b+11/2^{b+1}1/2b+1, with the two end points −2b−2^b−2b and 2b2^b2b being selected with probability 1/2b+21/2^{b+2}1/2b+2. The main advantage of this distribution is to be bounded, whereas the usual Central Normal Distribution one is not. In some practical cases, this can simplify the use of homomorphic computation. The choice of the bound impacts the security level: increasing the bound enhances security while keeping other factors constant.TFHE-rs encodes the noise in the least significant bits of each plaintext. Each leveled computation increases the value of the noise. If too many computations are performed, the noise will eventually overflow into the message bits and lead to an incorrect result.The following figure illustrates how the extra bit of noise is incurred during an addition operation.Noise overtaking the plaintexts after homomorphic addition. Most significant bits are on the left.TFHE-rs enables automatic noise management by performing bootstrapping operations to reset the noise.Programmable BootStrapping (PBS)The bootstrapping of TFHE is programmable. This allows any function to be homomorphically computed over an encrypted input, while also reducing the noise. These functions are represented by look-up tables.In general, the computation of a PBS is preceded or followed by a keyswitch, an operation to change the encryption key. The output ciphertext is then encrypted with the same key as the input one. To do this, two (public) evaluation keys are required: a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key.These operations are quite complex to describe in short, you can find more details about these operations (or about TFHE in general) in the TFHE Deep Dive.CarrySince encoded values have a fixed precision, operating on them can produce results that are outside of the original interval. To avoid losing precision or wrapping around the interval, TFHE-rs uses additional bits by defining bits of padding on the most significant bits.For example, when adding two ciphertexts, the sum could exceed the range of either ciphertext, and thus necessitate a carry that would then be transferred onto the first padding bit. In the following figure, each plaintext over 32 bits has one bit of padding on its left (the most significant bit). After the addition, the padding bit gets consumed to accommodate the carry. We refer to this process as consuming bits of padding. Without any padding-left, further additions may not produce accurate results.SecurityBy default, the cryptographic parameters provided by TFHE-rs ensure at least 128 bits of security. The security has been evaluated using the latest versions of the Lattice Estimator (repository) with red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16.For the High-Level API the default parameters are selected with a bootstrapping failure probability (or error probability) fixed at perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 for the x86 CPU backend, and perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64 for the GPU backend.
A failure probability below 2−1282^{-128}2−128 ensures that our implementation is resilient against attacks in the IND-CPA-D model [1]. In the case where only the IND-CPA model is considered, there is a possibility to choose parameters with a perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64, see the dedicated Parameters section[1] Li, Baiyu, et al. "Securing approximate homomorphic encryption using differential privacy." Annual International Cryptology Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022.The parameter sets for the x86 CPU backend with a perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 are obtained using the drift mitigation technique described in [2].[2]Bernard, Olivier, et al. "Drifting Towards Better Error Probabilities in Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes".Classical public key encryption.In classical public key encryption, the public key contains a given number of ciphertexts all encrypting the value 0. By setting the number of encryptions to 0 in the public key at m=⌈(n+1)log⁡(q)⌉+λm = \lceil (n+1) \log(q) \rceil + \lambdam=⌈(n+1)log(q)⌉+λ, where nnn is the LWE dimension, qqq is the ciphertext modulus, and λ\lambdaλ is the number of security bits. This construction is secure due to the leftover hash lemma, which relates to the impossibility of breaking the underlying multiple subset sum problem. This guarantees both a high-density subset sum and an exponentially large number of possible associated random vectors per LWE sample (a,b)(a,b)(a,b).PreviousZero-knowledge proof benchmarksNextTypesLast updated 5 months agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rs

Homomorphic case changing on Ascii string | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringThis tutorial demonstrates how to build your own data type that represents an ASCII string in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) by implementing to_lower and to_upper functions.Since version 0.11, TFHE-rs has introduced the strings feature, which provides an easy to use FHE strings API. See the fhe strings guide for more information.An ASCII character is stored in 7 bits. In this tutorial, we use the FheUint8 to store an encrypted ASCII:The uppercase letters are in the range [65, 90]The lowercase letters are in the range [97, 122]The relationship between uppercase and lowercase letters is defined as follows:lower_case = upper_case + UP_LOW_DISTANCEupper_case = lower_case - UP_LOW_DISTANCEWhere UP_LOW_DISTANCE = 32Types and methodsThis type stores the encrypted characters as a Vec<FheUint8> to implement case conversion functions.To use the FheUint8 type, enable the integer feature:
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.4.1", features = ["integer"] }The MyFheString::encrypt function performs data validation to ensure the input string contains only ASCII characters.In FHE operations, direct branching on encrypted values is not possible. However, you can evaluate a boolean condition to obtain the desired outcome. Here is an example to check and convert the 'char' to a lowercase without using a branch:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
if c > 64 && c < 91 {
c + UP_LOW_DISTANCE
} else {
c
}
}You can remove the branch this way:
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: u8) -> u8 {
c + ((c > 64) as u8 & (c < 91) as u8) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}This method can adapt to operations on homomorphic integers:
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::FheUint8;
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}Full example:use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ClientKey, ConfigBuilder, FheUint8};
const UP_LOW_DISTANCE: u8 = 32;
struct MyFheString {
bytes: Vec<FheUint8>,
}
fn to_upper(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c - FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(96) & c.lt(123)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
fn to_lower(c: &FheUint8) -> FheUint8 {
c + FheUint8::cast_from(c.gt(64) & c.lt(91)) * UP_LOW_DISTANCE
}
impl MyFheString {
fn encrypt(string: &str, client_key: &ClientKey) -> Self {
assert!(
string.is_ascii(),
"The input string must only contain ascii letters"
);
let fhe_bytes: Vec<FheUint8> = string
.bytes()
.map(|b| FheUint8::encrypt(b, client_key))
.collect();
Self { bytes: fhe_bytes }
}
fn decrypt(&self, client_key: &ClientKey) -> String {
let ascii_bytes: Vec<u8> = self
.bytes
.iter()
.map(|fhe_b| fhe_b.decrypt(client_key))
.collect();
String::from_utf8(ascii_bytes).unwrap()
}
fn to_upper(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_upper).collect(),
}
}
fn to_lower(&self) -> Self {
Self {
bytes: self.bytes.iter().map(to_lower).collect(),
}
}
}
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default()
.build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string = MyFheString::encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key);
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_upper();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lower();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");
}Using TFHE-rs strings featureThis code can be greatly simplified by using the strings feature from TFHE-rs.First, add the feature in your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tfhe = { version = "~1.4.1", features = ["strings"] }The FheAsciiString type allows to simply do homomorphic case changing of encrypted strings (and much more!):use tfhe::{generate_keys, set_server_key, ConfigBuilder, FheAsciiString};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
set_server_key(server_key);
let my_string =
FheAsciiString::try_encrypt("Hello Zama, how is it going?", &client_key).unwrap();
let verif_string = my_string.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Start string: {verif_string}");
let my_string_upper = my_string.to_uppercase();
let verif_string = my_string_upper.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Upper string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "HELLO ZAMA, HOW IS IT GOING?");
let my_string_lower = my_string_upper.to_lowercase();
let verif_string = my_string_lower.decrypt(&client_key);
println!("Lower string: {verif_string}");
assert_eq!(verif_string, "hello zama, how is it going?");

# SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rs

SHA256 with Boolean API | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSHA256 with Boolean APIThis tutorial guides you to convert a regular SHA-256 function to its homomorphic version, with considerations of optimal performances. You will learn:The basics of the SHA-256 function.The steps to implement SHA-256 homomorphically.SHA-256 basicsFirst, you need to implement the SHA-256 function. You can find the official specification for SHA-256 here. We summarize the three key aspects of SHA-256 outlined in the document:PaddingThe SHA-256 function processes the input data in blocks or chunks of 512 bits. Before performing the hash computations, prepare the data as follows:Append a single "1" bitAppend "0" bits until exactly 64 bits remain to make the message length a multiple of 512Append the last 64 bits as a binary encoding of the original input lengthIn this diagram, the numbers on the top represent the length of the padded input at each position. The formula L+1+k+64 ensures that the length reaches a multiple of 512, matching the required length of the padded input.Operations and functionsWe will use bitwise AND, XOR, NOT, addition modulo 2^32, the Rotate Right (ROTR) and Shift Right (SHR) operations as building blocks for functions inside the SHA-256 computation. These operations all use 32-bit words and produce new words.We combine these operations inside the sigma (with 4 variations), Ch, and Maj functions. When changing SHA-256 to the homomorphic computation, we will mainly change the code of each operation.Here is the definition of each function:Maj(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) XOR (y AND z)
Σ0(x) = ROTR-2(x) XOR ROTR-13(x) XOR ROTR-22(x)
Σ1(x) = ROTR-6(x) XOR ROTR-11(x) XOR ROTR-25(x)
σ0(x) = ROTR-7(x) XOR ROTR-18(x) XOR SHR-3(x)
σ1(x) = ROTR-17(x) XOR ROTR-19(x) XOR SHR-10(x)We simplify Maj using the Boolean distributive law: (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) = x AND (y XOR z), as shown below:We simplify Ch using a single bitwise multiplexer. Here's the truth table of the Ch expression.00000011010001111000101011011111This table shows that the result equals to z when x = 0, and the result equals to y when x = 1, which means if x {y} else {z}. Hence we can replace the 4 bitwise operations of Ch by a single bitwise multiplexer.All these operations can be evaluated homomorphically:ROTR and SHR: They can be evaluated by changing the index of each ecrypted bit of the word without using any homomorphic operation.Bitwise AND, XOR and multiplexer: They can be computed homomorphicallyAddition modulo 2^32: It can be broken down into boolean homomorphic operations.SHA-256 computationThe SHA-256 function processes data in 512-bit chunks. Here is what happens during computation:The 512-bit chunk is computed into 16 words, each containing 32 bits.Another 48 words are computed using the previous function.After computing the 64 words, within the same chunk, a compression loop will compute a hash value (8 32-bit words) using the previous functions and some constants to mix everything up.This entire process iterate through each 512-bit chunk of your data.When we finish the last chunk iteration, the resulting hash values will be the output of the SHA-256 function.Here is an example of this function using arrays of 32 bools to represent words:
// Initialize hash values with constant values
let mut hash: [[bool; 32]; 8] = [
hex_to_bools(0x6a09e667), hex_to_bools(0xbb67ae85),
hex_to_bools(0x3c6ef372), hex_to_bools(0xa54ff53a),

hex_to_bools(0x1f83d9ab), hex_to_bools(0x5be0cd19),
];
let chunks = padded_input.chunks(512);
for chunk in chunks {
let mut w = [[false; 32]; 64];
// Copy first 16 words from current chunk
for i in 0..16 {
w[i].copy_from_slice(&chunk[i * 32..(i + 1) * 32]);
}
// Compute the other 48 words
for i in 16..64 {
w[i] = add(add(add(sigma1(&w[i - 2]), w[i - 7]), sigma0(&w[i - 15])), w[i - 16]);
}
let mut a = hash[0];
let mut b = hash[1];
let mut c = hash[2];
let mut d = hash[3];
let mut e = hash[4];
let mut f = hash[5];

}
// Concatenate the final hash values to produce a 256-bit hash

}Homomorphic SHA-256 on encrypted dataTo convert SHA-256 to a homomorphic version, you can replace each bit of padded_input with a fully homomorphic encryption of the same bit value and operate on the encrypted value using homomorphic operations.While the structure of the SHA-256 function remains the same, there are some important considerations in the code:The function signature and the borrowing rules should adapt to the ciphertext type (representing the encrypted bits).Implementing SHA-256 operations with homomorphic encryption uses homomorphic boolean operations internally.Homomorphic operations on encrypted data can be very expensive. Consider these options for better speed:Remove unnecessary use of homomorphic operations and maximize parallelization.Simplify the code with Rayon crate that parallelizes iterators and manages threads efficiently.The final code is available here.Now let's dive into details of each SHA256 operation.Rotate Right and Shift RightRotate Right and Shift Right can be evaluated by changing the position of each encrypted bit in the word, requiring no homomorphic operations. Here is the implementation: let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result
}
fn shift_right(x: &[Ciphertext; 32], n: usize, sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut result = x.clone();
result.rotate_right(n);
result[..n].fill_with(|| sk.trivial_encrypt(false));
result
}Bitwise XOR, AND, MultiplexerTo implement these operations, we will use the xor, and mux methods from the TFHE-rs library to perform each boolean operation homomorphically.For better efficiency, we can parallelize the homomorphic computations because we operate bitwise. It means that we can homomorphically XOR the bits at index 0 of two words using one thread while XORing the bits at index 1 using another thread, and so on. This approach allows for the computation of bitwise operations using up to 32 concurrent threads, corresponding to the 32-bit words used.Here is the implementation of the bitwise homomorphic XOR operation. The par_iter and par_iter_mut methods create a parallel iterator that we use to compute each XOR efficiently. The other two bitwise operations are implemented in the same way. let mut result = a.clone();
result.par_iter_mut()
.zip(a.par_iter().zip(b.par_iter()))
.for_each(|(dst, (lhs, rhs))| *dst = sk.xor(lhs, rhs));
result
}Addition modulo 2^32This might be the trickiest operation to efficiently implement in a homomorphic manner. A naive implementation could use the Ripple Carry Adder algorithm, which is straightforward but cannot be parallelized because each step depends on the previous one.A better choice is to use Carry Lookahead Adder, which allows us to use the parallelized AND and XOR bitwise operations. With this design, our adder is around 50% faster than the Ripple Carry Adder. let propagate = xor(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
let generate = and(a, b, sk); // Parallelized bitwise AND
let carry = compute_carry(&propagate, &generate, sk);
let sum = xor(&propagate, &carry, sk); // Parallelized bitwise XOR
sum
}
fn compute_carry(propagate: &[Ciphertext; 32], generate: &[Ciphertext; 32], sk: &ServerKey) -> [Ciphertext; 32] {
let mut carry = trivial_bools(&[false; 32], sk);
carry[31] = sk.trivial_encrypt(false);
for i in (0..31).rev() {
carry[i] = sk.or(&generate[i + 1], &sk.and(&propagate[i + 1], &carry[i + 1]));
}
carry
}To further optimize performance, we use parallel prefix algorithms to parallelize the function that computes the carry signals. These algorithms involve more (homomorphic) boolean operations and their parallel nature speeds up the processing. We have implemented the Brent-Kung and Ladner-Fischer algorithms with different tradeoffs:Brent-Kung has the least amount of boolean operations we could find (140 when using grey cells, for 32-bit numbers), which makes it suitable when we can't process many operations concurrently and fast. Our results confirm that it's indeed faster than both the sequential algorithm and Ladner-Fischer when run on regular computers.On the other hand, Ladner-Fischer performs more boolean operations (209 using grey cells) than Brent-Kung, but they are performed in larger batches. Hence we can compute more operations in parallel and finish earlier, but we need more fast threads available or they will slow down the carry signals computation. Ladner-Fischer can be suitable when using cloud-based computing services, which offer many high-speed threads.Our implementation uses Brent-Kung by default, but you can enable Ladner-Fischer by using the --ladner-fischer command line argument.For more information about parallel prefix adders, you can read this paper or this other paper.Finally, with all these SHA-256 operations working homomorphically, our functions will be homomomorphic as well along with the whole SHA-256 function (after adapting the code to work with the Ciphertext type).More parallel processingLet's talk about other performance improvements we can make before we finish.In the main sha256_fhe, you can perform some functions in parallel. For example, in the compression loop, temp1 and temp2 can be computed in parallel by using the rayon::join() function when there is a CPU available. The two temporary values in the compression loop are the result of multiple additions, so you can use nested calls to rayon::join() to parallelize more operations.Another way to speed up consecutive additions would be using the Carry Save Adder, a very efficient adder that takes 3 numbers and returns a sum and a carry sequence. If our inputs are A, B, and C, we can construct a CSA with our previously implemented Maj function and the bitwise XOR operation as follows:Sum = A XOR B XOR CBy chaining CSAs, we can input the sum and carry from a preceding stage along with another number into a new CSA. Finally, to get the result of the additions we add the sum and carry sequences using a conventional adder. In the end, we are performing the same number of additions, but some of them are now CSAs, speeding up the process. Below is the illustration of this process in the temp1 and temp2 computations. || {
let ((sum, carry), s1) = rayon::join(
|| {
let ((sum, carry), ch) = rayon::join(
|| csa(&h, &w[i], &trivial_bools(&hex_to_bools(K[i]), sk), sk),
|| ch(&e, &f, &g, sk),
);
csa(&sum, &carry, &ch, sk)
},
|| sigma_upper_case_1(&e, sk)
);
let (sum, carry) = csa(&sum, &carry, &s1, sk);
add(&sum, &carry, sk)
},
|| {
add(&sigma_upper_case_0(&a, sk), &maj(&a, &b, &c, sk), sk)
},
);The first closure of the outer call to join will return temp1 and the second temp2.Inside the first outer closure, we call join recursively until we add the value h, the current word w[i], and the current constant K[i] by using the CSA, while potentially computing the ch function in parallel. Then we take the sum, carry, and ch values and add them again using the CSA.All this is done while potentially computing the sigma_upper_case_1 function. Finally we input the previous sum, carry, and sigma values to the CSA and perform the final addition with add. Once again, this is done while potentially computing sigma_upper_case_0 and maj and adding them to get temp2, in the second outer closure.With these types of changes, we finally get a homomorphic SHA256 function that doesn't leave unused computational resources.How to use SHA256_boolFirst, use the --release flag when running the program. Considering the implementation of encrypt_bools and decrypt_bools, the use of SHA-256 will be as follows: let matches = Command::new("Homomorphic sha256")
.arg(Arg::new("ladner_fischer")
.long("ladner-fischer")
.help("Use the Ladner Fischer parallel prefix algorithm for additions")
.action(ArgAction::SetTrue))
.get_matches();
// If set using the command line flag "--ladner-fischer" this algorithm will be used in additions
let ladner_fischer: bool = matches.get_flag("ladner_fischer");
// INTRODUCE INPUT FROM STDIN
let mut input = String::new();
println!("Write input to hash:");
io::stdin()
.read_line(&mut input)
.expect("Failed to read line");
input = input.trim_end_matches('\n').to_string();
println!("You entered: \"{}\"", input);
// CLIENT PADS DATA AND ENCRYPTS IT
let (ck, sk) = gen_keys();
let padded_input = pad_sha256_input(&input);
let encrypted_input = encrypt_bools(&padded_input, &ck);
// SERVER COMPUTES OVER THE ENCRYPTED PADDED DATA
println!("Computing the hash");
let encrypted_output = sha256_fhe(encrypted_input, ladner_fischer, &sk);
// CLIENT DECRYPTS THE OUTPUT
let output = decrypt_bools(&encrypted_output, &ck);
let outhex = bools_to_hex(output);
println!("{}", outhex);
}We can supply the data to hash using a file instead of the command line by using stdin . For example, if the file input.txt is in the same directory as the project, we can use the following shell command after building with cargo build --release:The program accepts hexadecimal inputs. The input must start with "0x" and contain only valid hex digits, otherwise it will be interpreted as text.Finally， padding is performed on the client side. This has the advantage of hiding the exact length of the input content from the server, thus avoiding the server extracting information from the length, even though the content is fully encrypted.It is also feasible to perform padding on the server side. The padding function would take the encrypted input and pad it with trivial bit encryptions. We can then integrate the padding function into the sha256_fhe function computed by the server.PreviousHomomorphic case changing on Ascii stringNextAll tutorialsLast updated 2 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

# Security and cryptography | TFHE-rs

Security and cryptography | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageSecurity and cryptographyThis document introduces the cryptographic concepts of the scheme of Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) and the security considerations of TFHE-rs.For an in-depth description of TFHE you can read the TFHE-rs handbook.TFHETFHE-rs is a cryptographic library that implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption using the TFHE scheme. You should understand the basics of TFHE to consider its limitations, such as:The precision: TFHE has limitations on the number of bits used to represent plaintext values.The execution time: TFHE operations are slower than native operations due to their complexity.LWE ciphertextsTFHE-rs primarily utilizes Learning With Errors (LWE) ciphertexts. The LWE problem forms the basis of TFHE's security and is considered resistant to quantum attacks.An LWE Ciphertext is a collection of 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integers. Before encrypting a message in an LWE ciphertext, you first need to encode it as a plaintext by shifting the message to the most significant bits of the unsigned integer type used.Then, you add a small random value called noise to the least significant bits. This noise is crucial in ensuring the security of the ciphertext.plaintext=(Δ∗m)+eplaintext = (\Delta * m) + eplaintext=(Δ∗m)+em∈Zpm \in \mathbb{Z}_pm∈Zp​To get a ciphertext from a plaintext, you must encrypt the plaintext using a secret key.An LWE secret key is a list of n random integers: S=(s0,...,sn−1)S = (s_0, ..., s_{n-1})S=(s0​,...,sn−1​). nnn is called the LweDimensionLweDimensionLweDimensionAn LWE ciphertext is composed of two parts:The mask (a0,...,an−1)(a_0, ..., a_{n-1})(a0​,...,an−1​)The body bbbThe mask of a fresh ciphertext (the result of an encryption, and not the result of operations such as ciphertext addition) is a list of n uniformly random values.The body is computed as follows:b=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintextb = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintextb=(∑i=0n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintextNow that the encryption scheme is defined, let's review the example of the addition between ciphertexts to illustrate why it is slower to compute over encrypted data.To add two ciphertexts, we must add their maskmaskmask and bodybodybody:ct0=(a0,...,an−1,b)ct1=(a0′,...,an−1′,b′)ct2=ct0+ct1ct2=(a0+a0′,...,an−1+an−1′,b+b′)b+b′=(∑i=0n−1ai∗si)+plaintext+(∑i=0n−1ai′∗si)+plaintext′b+b′=(∑i=0n−1(ai+ai′)∗si)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′ct_0 = (a_{0}, ..., a_{n-1}, b) \\ ct_1 = (a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b^{\prime}) \\ ct_{2} = ct_0 + ct_1 \\ ct_{2} = (a_{0} + a_{0}^{\prime}, ..., a_{n-1} + a_{n-1}^{\prime}, b + b^{\prime})\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i * s_i}) + plaintext + (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{a_i^{\prime} * s_i}) + plaintext^{\prime}\\ b + b^{\prime} = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}{(a_i + a_i^{\prime})* s_i}) + \Delta m + \Delta m^{\prime} + e + e^{\prime}\\ct0​=(a0​,...,an−1​,b)ct1​=(a0′​,...,an−1′​,b′)ct2​=ct0​+ct1​ct2​=(a0​+a0′​,...,an−1​+an−1′​,b+b′)b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​ai​∗si​)+plaintext+(i=0∑n−1​ai′​∗si​)+plaintext′b+b′=(i=0∑n−1​(ai​+ai′​)∗si​)+Δm+Δm′+e+e′To add ciphertexts, it is necessary to add both their masks and bodies. The operation involves adding n+1n + 1n+1 elements, rather than just adding two integers. This is an intuitive example to show how FHE computation is slower compared to plaintext computation. However, other operations are far more expensive (for example, the computation of a lookup table using Programmable Bootstrapping).Programmable Bootstrapping, noise management, and carry bitsIn FHE, two types of operations can be applied to ciphertexts:Leveled operations, which increase the noise in the ciphertextBootstrapped operations, which reduce the noise in the ciphertextNoise is critical in FHE because it can tamper with the message if not tracked and managed properly. Bootstrapping operations decrease noise within the ciphertexts and guarantee the correctness of computation. The rest of the operations do not need bootstrapping operations, thus they are called leveled operations and are usually very fast as a result.The following sections explain the concept of noise and padding in ciphertexts.NoiseTo ensure security, LWE requires random noise to be added to the message during encryption.TFHE scheme draws this random noise either from:A Centered Normal Distribution with a standard deviation parameter. The choice of standard deviation impacts the security level: increasing the standard deviation enhances security while keeping other factors constant.A Tweaked Uniform (TUniform) Distribution with a bound parameter 2b2^b2b defined as follows: any value in the interval (−2b,...,2b)(−2^b, ... , 2^b)(−2b,...,2b) is selected with probability 1/2b+11/2^{b+1}1/2b+1, with the two end points −2b−2^b−2b and 2b2^b2b being selected with probability 1/2b+21/2^{b+2}1/2b+2. The main advantage of this distribution is to be bounded, whereas the usual Central Normal Distribution one is not. In some practical cases, this can simplify the use of homomorphic computation. The choice of the bound impacts the security level: increasing the bound enhances security while keeping other factors constant.TFHE-rs encodes the noise in the least significant bits of each plaintext. Each leveled computation increases the value of the noise. If too many computations are performed, the noise will eventually overflow into the message bits and lead to an incorrect result.The following figure illustrates how the extra bit of noise is incurred during an addition operation.Noise overtaking the plaintexts after homomorphic addition. Most significant bits are on the left.TFHE-rs enables automatic noise management by performing bootstrapping operations to reset the noise.Programmable BootStrapping (PBS)The bootstrapping of TFHE is programmable. This allows any function to be homomorphically computed over an encrypted input, while also reducing the noise. These functions are represented by look-up tables.In general, the computation of a PBS is preceded or followed by a keyswitch, an operation to change the encryption key. The output ciphertext is then encrypted with the same key as the input one. To do this, two (public) evaluation keys are required: a bootstrapping key and a keyswitching key.These operations are quite complex to describe in short, you can find more details about these operations (or about TFHE in general) in the TFHE Deep Dive.CarrySince encoded values have a fixed precision, operating on them can produce results that are outside of the original interval. To avoid losing precision or wrapping around the interval, TFHE-rs uses additional bits by defining bits of padding on the most significant bits.For example, when adding two ciphertexts, the sum could exceed the range of either ciphertext, and thus necessitate a carry that would then be transferred onto the first padding bit. In the following figure, each plaintext over 32 bits has one bit of padding on its left (the most significant bit). After the addition, the padding bit gets consumed to accommodate the carry. We refer to this process as consuming bits of padding. Without any padding-left, further additions may not produce accurate results.SecurityBy default, the cryptographic parameters provided by TFHE-rs ensure at least 128 bits of security. The security has been evaluated using the latest versions of the Lattice Estimator (repository) with red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16.For the High-Level API the default parameters are selected with a bootstrapping failure probability (or error probability) fixed at perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 for all backends (x86 CPU, GPU and HPU). A failure probability below 2−1282^{-128}2−128 ensures that our implementation is resilient against attacks in the IND-CPA-D model [1]. In the case where only the IND-CPA model is considered, there is a possibility to choose parameters with a perror≤2−64p_{error} \le 2^{-64}perror​≤2−64, see the dedicated Parameters section[1] Li, Baiyu, et al. "Securing approximate homomorphic encryption using differential privacy." Annual International Cryptology Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022.The parameter sets for the x86 CPU backend with a perror≤2−128p_{error} \le 2^{-128}perror​≤2−128 are obtained using the drift mitigation technique described in [2].[2]Bernard, Olivier, et al. "Drifting Towards Better Error Probabilities in Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes".Classical public key encryption.In classical public key encryption, the public key contains a given number of ciphertexts all encrypting the value 0. By setting the number of encryptions to 0 in the public key at m=⌈(n+1)log⁡(q)⌉+λm = \lceil (n+1) \log(q) \rceil + \lambdam=⌈(n+1)log(q)⌉+λ, where nnn is the LWE dimension, qqq is the ciphertext modulus, and λ\lambdaλ is the number of security bits. This construction is secure due to the leftover hash lemma, which relates to the impossibility of breaking the underlying multiple subset sum problem. This guarantees both a high-density subset sum and an exponentially large number of possible associated random vectors per LWE sample (a,b)(a,b)(a,b).PreviousZero-knowledge proof benchmarksNextTypesLast updated 2 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

HPU acceleration | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageHPU accelerationThis guide explains how to update your existing program to leverage HPU acceleration, or to start a new program using HPU.TFHE-rs now supports a HPU backend based on FPGA implementation, enabling integer arithmetic operations on encrypted data.PrerequisitesAn AMD/Xilinx V80 board installed on a server running Linux with kernel 5.15.0-*A HPU bitstream that you can find (or build) in HPU fpga repository and load in V80 flash and FPGA using its READMEAMI linux device driver version from this forkQDMA linux device driver version from this forkRust version - check this pageImporting to your projectTo use the TFHE-rs HPU backend in your project, add the following dependency in your Cargo.toml.= { version = "~1.4.1", features = ["integer", "hpu-v80"] }For optimal performance when using TFHE-rs, run your code in release mode with the --release flag.Supported platformsTFHE-rs HPU backend is only supported on Linux (x86).LinuxSupportedUnsupportedmacOSUnsupportedUnsupportedWindowsUnsupportedUnsupportedA first exampleConfiguring and creating keys.Comparing to the CPU example, HPU set up differs in the key creation and device registration, as detailed hereHere is a full example (combining the client and server parts):use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::tfhe_hpu_backend::prelude::*;
fn main() {
// Instantiate HpuDevice --------------------------------------------------
// HPU configuration knobs are retrieved from a TOML configuration file. Prebuilt configurations could be find in `backends/tfhe-hpu-backend/config_store`
// For ease of use a setup_hpu.sh script is available in repository root folder and it handle the required environment variables setup and driver initialisation
// More details are available in `backends/tfhe-hpu-backend/README.md`
let hpu_device = HpuDevice::from_config(ShellString::new("${HPU_BACKEND_DIR}/config_store/${HPU_CONFIG}/hpu_config.toml".to_string()).expand().as_str());
// Generate keys ----------------------------------------------------------
let config = Config::from_hpu_device(&hpu_device);
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
// Register HpuDevice and key as thread-local engine
set_server_key((hpu_device, compressed_server_key));
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
// Server-side computation
let result = a + b;
// Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}Setting the hpuAn HPU device is built for a given parameter set. At this point, because HPU is still a prototype, the software provided is retrieving this parameter set from an instantiated HpuDevice. Once retrieved, reading some HPU registers, this parameter set is used by the example applications to generate both client and compressed server keys. Server key has then to be decompressed by the server to be converted into the right format and uploaded to the device. Once decompressed, the operations between CPU and HPU are identical.EncryptionOn the client-side, the method to encrypt the data is exactly the same than the CPU one, as shown in the following example: let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);ComputationThe server first needs to set up its keys with set_server_key((hpu_device, compressed_server_key)).Then, homomorphic computations are performed using the same approach as the CPU operations. let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);DecryptionFinally, the client decrypts the result using:List of available operationsThe HPU backend includes the following operations for unsigned encrypted integers:namesymbolEnc/EncEnc/ IntAdd+✔️✔️Sub-✔️✔️Mul*✔️✔️Div/✔️✔️Rem%✔️✔️BitAnd&✔️✔️BitOr|✔️✔️BitXor^✔️✔️Shr>>✔️✔️Shl<<✔️✔️Rotate rightrotate_right✔️✔️Rotate leftrotate_left✔️✔️Minmin✔️✔️Maxmax✔️✔️Greater thangt✔️✔️Greater or equal thange✔️✔️Lower thanlt✔️✔️Lower or equal thanle✔️✔️Equaleq✔️✔️Not Equalne✔️✔️Ternary operatorselect✔️✖️Integer logarithmilog2✔️N/ACount trailing/leading onesleading_zeros✔️N/ACount trailing/leading zerosleading_ones✔️N/AAll operations follow the same syntax than the one described in here.PreviousMulti-GPU supportNextBenchmarkLast updated 2 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

Compression can be applied on freshly encrypted ciphertexts or on ciphertexts that are the result of FHE integer operations.

# Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rs

Multi-GPU support | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationMulti-GPU supportThis guide explains the multi-GPU support of TFHE-rs, and walks through a practical example of performing a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions using manual GPU dispatching to improve the performance.Multi-GPU programming modelTFHE-rs supports platforms with multiple GPUs. By default, when decompressing a server key with the decompress_to_gpu function, TFHE-rs will assign all available GPUs to the server key. TFHE-rs uses all GPUs assigned to the current server key when executing operations. Depending on the type and number of available GPUs, this automatic mechanism may not achieve optimal throughput.Most integer operations have low GPU-intensity: they use few GPU cores and may not fully use the resources of a single GPU. Manual scheduling of operations on a single or on several GPUs, so that several such operations can be processed in parallel, is helpful for these types of low-GPU intensity operations.Other types of operations run optimally over several GPUs without manual scheduling but may benefit from manual scheduling on different GPUs when more than 4 GPUs are available:operations on operands of 64-bits or moremultiplication of operands of 8-bits or moreTo improve throughput by increasing GPU core utilization on all available GPUs, you can:optimize the number of GPUs assigned to a decompressed server key using the decompress_to_specific_gpu function.execute several operations in parallel on the same GPUAPI elements discussed in this documenttfhe::ServerKey::decompress_to_specific_gpu: decompresses a server key to one or multiple GPUstfhe::set_server_key: sets the current server key. When this is a GPU key, this function activates execution of integer operations on all GPUs assigned to this key. Moreover, this function will create anew CUDA stream on the current CPU thread.Multi-GPU operation scheduling exampleWhen selecting a specific GPU to execute on, there are two essential requirements that are different from a default GPU execution:You must create a GPU server key on each GPU, or subset of GPUs, individually.The batch of operations must be distributed on all the GPUs manually.Step 1: Decompress the server key to each GPUInstead of a single server key being used across all GPUs automatically, you’ll need decompress the server key to each GPU, so that the key is available in memory. For example, by default, the GPU server key is decompressed and loaded onto all available GPUs automatically as follows:fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let sks = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
}However, to use the multi-GPU selection feature, you can create a vector of server keys, each on a specific GPU:use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}Step 2: Define the inputs to operate onWe will be doing 100 additions in parallel on each GPU:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
}At this stage, the left and right inputs reside on the CPU. They have not yet been copied to the GPU.Step3: Dispatch the workloadsNow you need to split the calculation into as many chunks as there are GPUs. TFHE-rs allows you to execute additions in parallel across multiple GPUs by leveraging CUDA streams. CUDA stream management is not explicit in the High-Level(HL) API of TFHE-rs: streams are implicitly created through calls to set_server_key in a CPU thread. As a result, when you use .par_iter() on encrypted data within the HL API, and that computation is dispatched to a GPU, it behaves as expected—executing in parallel using CUDA streams. We’ll take advantage of this behavior to maximize throughput on a multi-GPU machine. In the following example, we split a large batch of encrypted 64-bit additions across multiple GPUs. Each GPU processes its own chunk of data in parallel, thanks to the creation of CUDA streams under the hood:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key = ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let right_inputs = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
left_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
.zip(
right_inputs
.par_chunks(chunk_size)
)
.enumerate()
.for_each(
|(i, (left_inputs_on_gpu_i, right_inputs_on_gpu_i))| {
left_inputs_on_gpu_i
.par_iter()
.zip(right_inputs_on_gpu_i.par_iter())
.for_each(|(left_input, right_input)| {
set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone());
let _ = left_input + right_input;
});
},
);
}In this example, par_chunks divides the input vectors into num_gpus chunks—one per GPU. Each chunk is then processed in parallel using .par_iter(). Inside the inner loop, calling set_server_key(sks_vec[i].clone()) sets the context for the GPU i and implicitly creates a new CUDA stream for GPU i. This enables parallel execution on each device. It’s important to note that, in this example, when using the + operator on encrypted inputs, data is first transferred from the CPU to the GPU before computation, the result then resides on the GPU i. You can learn more about how to inspect on which GPU a piece of data resides from the examples in this file: tfhe/src/high_level_api/tests/gpu_selection.rs.Going beyond: Restrict the number of CUDA streamsWhile the behavior of .par_iter() in TFHE-rs' HL API aligns with expectations and provides parallelism over encrypted data, it can become a performance bottleneck in some cases. This is due to the way CUDA streams are managed. CUDA streams allow for parallel execution on the GPU, but when too many are created, scheduling becomes inefficient. Instead of running in parallel, operations may fall back to sequential execution. In practice, having more than 10 streams already starts to negatively impact throughput. To address this, we can limit the number of streams used per GPU. The optimal number depends on the type of operation, but the general rule is: use as few streams as possible while still fully utilizing the GPU. For example, in the case of 64-bit encrypted additions, using 4 streams per GPU offers a good balance. Each GPU processes inputs in chunks of 4 operations in parallel, repeating this in batches until all inputs are handled. Here’s how this approach looks in code:use tfhe::prelude::*;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use tfhe::core_crypto::gpu::get_number_of_gpus;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let num_gpus = get_number_of_gpus();
let sks_vec = (0..num_gpus)
.map(|i| compressed_server_key.decompress_to_specific_gpu(GpuIndex::new(i)))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let batch_size = num_gpus * 100;
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let left_inputs = (0..batch_size)

.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let amounts = (0..batch_size)
.map(|_| FheUint64::encrypt(rng.gen::<u64>(), &client_key))
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
let chunk_size = (batch_size / num_gpus) as usize;
let num_streams_per_gpu = 4;

# A simple example | TFHE-rs

A simple example | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationA simple exampleThe example shown in this section computes the sum of two integers using the GPU. It contains code that can be split into a client-side and a server-side part, but for simplicity it is shown as a single snippet. Only the server-side benefits from GPU acceleration.This example shows how to use a single GPU to improve operation latency. It has the following structure:Client-side: Generate client keys and GPU server keys. Encrypt two numbersServer-side: Move server keys to GPU and perform the additionClient-side: Decrypt the resultThis example only performs an addition, but most FHE operations are supported on GPU. For a list see:OperationsAPI elements discussed in this documenttfhe::ConfigBuilder::default(): Instantiates the default cryptographic parameters. When the "gpu" feature is activated, the default parameters are GPU specific, which achieves optimal performance on GPUtfhe::ServerKey::decompress_to_gpu: decompresses a compressed ServerKey and copies it to all available GPUstfhe::set_server_key: sets the current server key. When this is a GPU key, this function activates execution of integer operations on all GPUs assigned to this key.A simple TFHE-rs program tfhe::{ConfigBuilder, set_server_key, FheUint8, ClientKey, CompressedServerKey};
use tfhe::prelude::*;
fn main() {
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let client_key= ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let gpu_key = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
let clear_a = 27u8;
let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);
//Server-side
set_server_key(gpu_key);
let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}When the "gpu" feature is activated, calling: let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build(); instantiates cryptographic parameters that are different from the CPU ones.Breakdown of the GPU TFHE-rs programKey generationComparing to the CPU example, in the code snippet above, the server-side must call decompress_to_gpu to enable GPU-execution for the ensuing operations on ciphertexts. This function assigns all available GPUs to the server key.Once the key is decompressed to GPU and set with set_server_key, operations on ciphertexts execute on the GPU. In the example above:compressed_server_key is a CompressedServerKey, stored on CPU. The client-side should ensure this key is generated with GPU cryptographic parameters.gpu_key is the CudaServerKey corresponding to compressed_server_key and is stored on the GPU assigned to it.set_server_key sets either a CPU or GPU key. In this example, compressed_server_key and gpu_key have GPU cryptographic parameters. A GPU server key can enable automatic parallelization on multiple GPUs.EncryptionOn the client-side, the method to encrypt the data is exactly the same as the CPU one, as shown in the following example: let clear_b = 128u8;
let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);Server-side computationThe server first needs to set up its keys with set_server_key(gpu_key). Then, homomorphic computations are performed using the same approach as the CPU operations. set_server_key(gpu_key);
let result = a + b;
//Client-side
let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;
assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);DecryptionFinally, the client decrypts the results using:Optimizing for throughputIn order to improve operation throughput, you can use multiple GPUs with fine-grained GPU scheduling, as detailed on the following page:https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs/blob/release/1.4.x/tfhe/docs/configuration/gpu-acceleration/multi_gpu.mdPreviousGPU accelerationNextOperationsLast updated 2 days agoWas this helpful?TFHE-rsConcreteConcrete MLfhEVMBlogDocumentationGithubFHE resourcesAboutIntroduction to FHEMediaCareers

ZK-POKs | TFHE-rsAPI referencesRelease noteFeature requestBug reportPowered by GitBookOn this pageGPU accelerationZK-POKsZero-knowledge proofs (ZK) are a powerful tool to assert that the encryption of a message is correctly formed with secure cryptographic parameters and helps thwart chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA) such as replay attacks.The CPU implementation is discussed in advanced features. During encryption, ZK proofs can be generated for a single ciphertext or for a list of ciphertexts. To use ciphertexts with proofs for computation, additional conversion steps are needed: proof expansion and proof verification. While both steps are necessary to use ciphertexts with proofs for computation, only proof expansion is sped up on GPU, while verification is performed by the CPU.ConfigurationYou can enable this feature using the flag: --features=zk-pok,gpu when building TFHE-rs.API elements discussed in this documenttfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList: a list of ciphertexts with accompanying ZK-proofs. The ciphertexts are stored in a compact form and must be expanded for computation.tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::verify_and_expand: verify the proofs for this ciphertext list and expand each ciphertext into a form that is supported for computation.Proven compact ciphertext listA proven compact list of ciphertexts can be seen as a compacted collection of ciphertexts for which encryption can be verified. This verification is currently only supported on the CPU, but the expansion can be sped up using the GPU. However, verification and expansion can be performed in parallel, efficiently using all the available computational resources.Supported typesEncrypted messages can be integers (like FheUint64) or booleans. The GPU backend does not currently support encrypted strings.ExampleThe following example shows how a client can encrypt and prove a ciphertext, and how a server can verify the proof, preprocess the ciphertext and run a computation on it on GPU:use tfhe::CompressedServerKey;
use tfhe::prelude::*;
use tfhe::set_server_key;
use tfhe::zk::{CompactPkeCrs, ZkComputeLoad};

// Indicate which parameters to use for the Compact Public Key encryption
let cpk_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_PKE_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// And parameters allowing to keyswitch/cast to the computation parameters.
let casting_params = tfhe::shortint::parameters::PARAM_KEYSWITCH_MESSAGE_2_CARRY_2_KS_PBS_TUNIFORM_2M128;
// Enable the dedicated parameters on the config
let config = tfhe::ConfigBuilder::with_custom_parameters(params)
.use_dedicated_compact_public_key_parameters((cpk_params, casting_params)).build();
// The CRS should be generated in an offline phase then shared to all clients and the server
let crs = CompactPkeCrs::from_config(config, 64).unwrap();
// Then use TFHE-rs as usual
let client_key = tfhe::ClientKey::generate(config);
let compressed_server_key = CompressedServerKey::new(&client_key);
let gpu_server_key = compressed_server_key.decompress_to_gpu();
let public_key = tfhe::CompactPublicKey::try_new(&client_key).unwrap();
// This can be left empty, but if provided allows to tie the proof to arbitrary data
let metadata = [b'T', b'F', b'H', b'E', b'-', b'r', b's'];
let clear_a = random::<u64>();
let clear_b = random::<u64>();
let proven_compact_list = tfhe::ProvenCompactCiphertextList::builder(&public_key)
.push(clear_a)
.push(clear_b)
.build_with_proof_packed(&crs, &metadata, ZkComputeLoad::Verify)?;
// Server side
let result = {
set_server_key(gpu_server_key);
// Verify the ciphertexts
let expander =
proven_compact_list.verify_and_expand(&crs, &public_key, &metadata)?;
let a: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(0)?.unwrap();
let b: tfhe::FheUint64 = expander.get(1)?.unwrap();
a + b
};
// Back on the client side
let a_plus_b: u64 = result.decrypt(&client_key);
